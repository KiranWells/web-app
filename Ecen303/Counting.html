# Counting

Because for equally likely sets, the probability is based on the number of outcomes out of a sample space, we need to be able to count the number of outcomes in the event and sample space. Here are a few strategies for counting.

## Cartesian Product

Given two sets, we can express the set of combinations of those two sets as their cartesian product, where every element of one set is paired with every element of another:

$$A \times B = \{(A_1, B_1), (A_1, B_2), ..., (A_2, B_1), (A_2, B_2), ..., ..., ... \}$$

This multiplies the size of the sets. $$|A\times B| = |A| * |B|$$

## Power Sets

The set of all subsets of a set has $2^n$ values, where $n$ is the size of a set, because for each element you have two choices: to include or exclude that element.

## Permutations

If we take the number of different collections of different items, and care about the orders, that is a **permutation**. For example, the number of permutations of $3$ different balls is $6$, or $3!$. In general, the number of permutations of $n$ different items is $n!$, because as soon as you put down one, you have one less to select from. So, your number of choices keep decreasing, leading to $n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ...$

~~Example: Permutations of Permutations

Imagine you have 10 books, 4 of math, 3 literature, 2 science, and one history. What number of permutations of the books are there if the subjects are all in the same location?

If the books could be in any order, then it would be ${10!}$. However, the subjects are all together. So they are each permutations, and we want a combination of those permutations. This gives:

$$4!\times 3!\times 2!\times 1!$$

However, we can also rearrange all the subjects on the shelf, giving four more objects to get permutations of. We then can have the books in any order inside of that permutation, so that is another multiplication:

$$4!\times 4!\times 3!\times 2!\times 1!$$

~~

### K-Permutations

If you select only $k$ elements out of the $n$ available, then you will have $n$ choices, then $(n-1)$, and so on to $(n - k + 1)$. So, we need to remove all multiplications after than from $n!$, giving:

$${n! \over (n - k)!}$$

## Combinations

In combinations, we are selecting $k$ elements of a set, and the order does not matter.

So, we can start by taking $n!$, and removing all of the elements after $k$, since we only want that many elements:

$$
{n! \over (n-k)!}
$$

Now, since order does not matter, we need to divide by $k$:

$$
{n! \over (n-k)!k!} = \left(\begin{array}{c}n \\ k\end{array}\right)
$$

This is the size of a k-combination of n elements.

~~Example: Committees

From a group of 5 women and 7 men, how many different committees consisting of 2 women and 3 men can be formed?

Here, we can take each gender separately, taking a 2-combination of the women:

$$\left(\begin{array}{c}5 \\ 2\end{array}\right)$$

and a 3-combination of the men:

$$\left(\begin{array}{c}7 \\ 3\end{array}\right)$$

And then take the product of them:

$$\left(\begin{array}{c}5 \\ 2\end{array}\right) \times \left(\begin{array}{c}7 \\ 3\end{array}\right)$$

Now, if two of the men refuse to serve on a committee together, we need to remove all combinations where they are together.

To find he number of combinations where they are together, we start with those two. There is only a single possibility where both of them are in a committee: selecting both of them. Then, we need to select the remainder of the committee, from the remaining people. That will look like this:

$$
1 *
\left(\begin{array}{c}7 - 2 \\ 3 - 2\end{array}\right)
$$

That should be subtracted from the number of possibilities for the men on the committee:

$$\left(\begin{array}{c}5 \\ 2\end{array}\right) \times \left[\left(\begin{array}{c}7 \\ 3\end{array}\right) - \left(\begin{array}{c}7 - 2 \\ 3 - 2\end{array}\right)\right]$$

~~

~~Example: Indistinguishable Balls

Given a set of $n+m$ balls, where $n$ are red and $m$ are green. Assume the same color balls are indistinguishable from one another. How many linear orderings are there?

Because the order is only based on the order of colors, we can consider this a combination of the positions of red balls, out of all of the balls. This gives:

$$\left(\begin{array}{c}n + m \\ n\end{array}\right)$$

Now, if there cannot be two adjacent red balls, then we can consider the spaces of the red balls to be $m+1$ different locations, where each location is a space between two green balls. This means we have $m+1$ spaces to choose from, as long as $n < m+1$. This gives:

$$\left(\begin{array}{c}m + 1 \\ n\end{array}\right)$$

~~

### Binomial Theorem

This is a theorem showing how a binomial expansion relates combinations (because of distribution):

$$(x + y)^n = \sum\limits_{k=0}^n \left(\begin{array}{c}n \\ k\end{array}\right) x^ky^{n-k}$$

This works because when you multiply out the power, each element will be combined with each other element. In each combination, there will be some xs and some ys, but the sum of both must be $n$, as they are multiplied together $n$ times.

From this theorem, by setting $x = y = 1$, we can discover a property of combinations:

$$2^n = \sum\limits_{k=0}^n \left(\begin{array}{c}n \\ k\end{array}\right)$$

The Power Set, then is the set of all combinations of all number of elements from n to k.


## Multinomial Partitioning

With a set of $n$ elements, how many different ways can we partition the set into $k$ subsets that subset $i$ has $n_i$ elements with $\sum\limits_{i=1}^k n_i = n$

So, first we select $n_1$ elements:

$$\left(\begin{array}{c}n \\ n_1\end{array}\right)$$

Then take $n_2$ from the remaining:

$$\left(\begin{array}{c}n-n_1 \\ n_2\end{array}\right)$$

Then take $n_3$ from the remaining:

$$\left(\begin{array}{c}n-n_1-n_2 \\ n_3\end{array}\right)$$

and so on, and then take the product of all of them:

$$\left(\begin{array}{c}n \\ n_1\end{array}\right)\times\left(\begin{array}{c}n-n_1 \\ n_2\end{array}\right)\times\left(\begin{array}{c}n-n_1-n_2 \\ n_3\end{array}\right)\times ...$$

Which simplifies to:

$$
\left(\begin{array}{c}n \\ n_1,n_2, n_3 ...\end{array}\right) = {n! \over n_1!n_2!n_3!...}
$$

This is the **multinomial coefficient**.

~~Example: Card deck

How many ways can a standard deck of 52 playing cards can be divided into four piles of 13 cards each?

This is the same as the above explanation:

$$
\left(\begin{array}{c}52 \\ 13,13,13,13\end{array}\right)
$$

If all 13 spades are in one pile, then we have a combination of four spaces for the spade pile and then the remaining cards:

$$
\left(\begin{array}{c}4 \\ 1 \end{array}\right)
\left(\begin{array}{c}39 \\ 13,13,13 \end{array}\right)
$$

What if each pile has exactly one ace?

Here, we need the possible combinations of aces, and then the combinations of the remaining 12 in each pile:

$$
4!\times 
\left(\begin{array}{c}48 \\ 12,12,12,12 \end{array}\right)
$$

What if all spades are in two of the piles and each of the piles contains at least one spade?

To do this, we need to subtract the possibilities where there are 13 spades in one pile from the possible combination of spade piles, in addition to everything else.

Combining it all: The number of combinations of where the spade piles are, a selection of 13 cards to make the rest of the two spade piles, the combination of the spade piles without the two combinations where there are 13 spades in one pile, and then the combination of the rest:

$$
\left(\begin{array}{c}4 \\ 2\end{array}\right)\times
\left(\begin{array}{c}39 \\ 13\end{array}\right)\times
\left[
  \left(\begin{array}{c}26 \\ 13,13\end{array}\right) 
  - 2
\right]\times
\left(\begin{array}{c}26 \\ 13,13\end{array}\right)
$$

~~

### Binary Partitioning

Imagine taking several items and deciding which out of a few bins to put them. This is a quite challenging problem, as we are selecting one box for each item, but the order that we place them in does not matter. 

Instead, we can view it as elements and dividers: with $k$ boxes, we need $k-1$ dividers to separate the elements. When we lay the final elements and dividers out, there will be $n+k-1$ elements and dividers, or $n+k-1$ locations. From those locations, we want to select $k-1$ locations for the dividers. The rest will be filled with the elements, but we are not concerned with their order.

Mathematically, it is equivalent to select the locations for the elements, leaving only a few for the dividers. This means the number of ways to partition is either selecting $k-1$ from $n+k-1$ locations, or selecting $n$ locations from $n+k-1$:

$$
\left(\begin{array}{c}
n + k - 1 
\\ 
k - 1
\end{array}\right)
=
\left(\begin{array}{c}
n + k - 1 
\\ 
n
\end{array}\right)
$$

## Sampling

When taking multiple samples from a sample set, there are a few different cases to examine:

- Replacement: can the same outcome be selected more than once?
- Order: do you need to record the order in which the outcomes were selected, or are you only concerned with their combination?

When selecting $k$ elements from a sample set of size $n$, the number of sets is:

1. With Replacement, with order: $n^k$ possibilities
2. Without Replacement, with order: ${n! \over (n - k)!}$ possibilities
3. With Replacement, without order: ${\left(\begin{array}{c}n + k - 1 \\ k\end{array}\right)}$ possibilities
4. Without Replacement, without order: $\left(\begin{array}{c}n \\ k\end{array}\right) = {n! \over (n - k)!k!}$ possibilities

The third case is quite tricky to reason out, as you can select any item as many times as possible. This means we cannot just divide with replacement with order by the number of permutations of $k$, since some elements may be identical, meaning there are really less than $k$ unique objects. 

Instead, we can notice that it is the same as **binary partitioning**, where we are selecting where to put $k$ choices out of $n$ bins.

~~Practice 1: License Plates

How many license plates are possible given the following rules:

- the first three parts are letters
- the last four are numbers
- the letters cannot be the same

Here we are sampling 3 letters without replacement with order, so ${26! \over (3 - 26)!} = 26 * 25 * 24$, and four digits with replacement and order, $10^4$.

~~

~~Practice 2: Arrangement of Identical Items

If there are 4 blue, 3 red, and 3 green balls, how many arrangements are possible?

Here, the best way to look at it is backwards: we are selecting places for each of the balls out of 10 locations, or partitioning 10 into 4, 3, and 3:

$$
\left(\begin{array}{c}
10 
\\ 
4\ 3\ 3
\end{array}\right)
$$

~~

~~Practice 3: Math to Story

In this case, take the following mathematical expression and use its probabilistic meaning to explain how it is true.

$$
\left(\begin{array}{c}
m + n
\\ 
k
\end{array}\right)
=
\sum\limits_{i=0}^k 
\left(\begin{array}{c}
m
\\ 
i
\end{array}\right)
\left(\begin{array}{c}
n
\\ 
k-i
\end{array}\right)
$$

In both cases, you are selecting $k$ values from $m+n$ elements. On the left side, you are directly selecting $k$ from $m+n$. On the right side, you are adding all the possible ways to divide $k$ choices between $m$ and $n$.

~~

~~Practice: Matching Problem

Given 100 people and 100 hats, and that each person owns their own unique hat, what is the probability of no person matching their hat if all of them are distributed randomly?

Here, to make the problem simpler, we are going to find the opposite probability: The probability of at least one person matching their hat.

$$P(E) = 1 - P(E^c)$$

So, the probability of the $i^{th}$ person getting their own hat is:

$$P(A_i) = {(n-1)! \over n!}$$

This is because one person matched, but all other people can be permuted freely.

The probability that two people got their hat is:

$$P(A_i \cap A_j) = {(n-2)! \over n!}$$

And the probability of $k$ people getting their hat is:

$$P(A_i \cap ...) = {(n- k) \over n!}$$

To get the probability of at least one person getting their hat, so:

$$P(\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^n A_i)$$

Which requires using the inclusion-exclusion principle to determine the union of all of the probabilities:

$$= \sum\limits_{i=1}^n P(A_i) - \sum\limits_{i,j}^n P(A_i\cap A_j) + \sum\limits_{i,j,k}^n P(A_i\cap A_j \cap A_k) ... + (-1)^{n-1} Pr\left(\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^n A_i\right)$$

And each of the summations can be summarized as selecting $k$ people from $n$ to be matched, which can then be multiplied by the probability of that many people matching:

$$= \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \left(\begin{array}{c}n \\ i\end{array}\right) \left((-1)^{i-1}{(n-i)\over n!}\right)$$

$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^n {(-1)^{i-1} \over i}$$

Interestingly, this turns out to be the same as the Taylor series expansion of $1 - e^x$ where $x = -1$. This means that the probability of no match is $\approxeq \frac{1}{e}$.

<!-- Extra problem: what is the probability of only one person matching?

Here, we need the probability of one person matching *and* no other person matching. 
In this case it is easier to compute the probability 

The probability of at least one person matching alone is the sum of the probability of each matching alone. So we can add the probabilities of each person matching alone. -->
