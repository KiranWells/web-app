# Continuous Random Variables

A continuous random variable $X$ is a random variable which comes from an *uncountably infinite* sample space. It is defined to have a CDF that can be written as:

$$F(x) = Pr(X \le x) = \int\limits_{-\infty}^x f(a)da,\ \ \forall x \in \mathbb{R}$$

For some *nonnegative* function $f(x)$. (It must be non-negative to ensure that the CDF is always increasing, and cannot go below 0.)

In this case, there cannot be a PMF, as individual elements of $X$ are not assigned a specific probability (in fact, $Pr(X=k) = 0$, because the CDF is continuous). *Ranges*, on the other hand, are assigned a probability, meaning the CDF can easily be defined. Instead of a PMF, a **probability density function** (PDF) $f(x)$ is used.

## Continuous Distribution Function Properties

the CDF of a continuous random variable is by definition continuous. In addition, the conditions for non-negativity, being increasing, and having a range from $[0,1]$ hold true the same as for discrete random variables.

The PDF can be derived from the CDF through taking the derivative.

$$f(x) = \frac{dF(x)}{dx}$$

The probability of a range is not dependent on which ends of the range are included:

$$Pr(X \in (x_1, x_2)) = Pr(X \in [x_1, x_2)) = Pr(X \in (x_1, x_2]) = Pr(X \in [x_1, x_2])$$

## Continuous random variables vs. discrete

The PMF of a discrete random variable is always guaranteed to be in the range $[0,1]$, but a PDF can be any non-negative value.

The CDF of discrete random variables is not always continuous, whereas the CDF of a CRV is.

When applying a function to a DRV, you can keep the same PMF (always summing up the probability of events which are mapped to the same value), but with a CRV, you need to account for the stretching of the range, and therefore the changing of the density function.
