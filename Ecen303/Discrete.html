# Discrete Random Variables

> Definition: Random Variable  
> A random variable is a real-valued *function* mapping the 
> outcomes of an experiment to a unique real number. This 
> function must have an inverse (since each value is unique).
> The inverse mapping of *any interval* belongs to the event space.

**Event space** is is the set of all subsets (the power set) of the sample space.

For example, a random variable for the roll of a die could be the number of dots on the die: each result of the experiment (a roll) is assigned to a *unique* value in the real numbers, $[1..6]$.

~~Example: repeated coin flips

A random variable $X_i$ is defined as 0 if the ith flip of a coin is a tail, and a 1 when it is a head. So, the number of heads in a series of $n$ tosses can be modeled as:

$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^n X_i$$

~~

This example shows one of the purposes of random variables: to allow for calculations on unknown probabilistic values.

A random variable is a **Discrete random variable** if it has a finite or countably infinite number of possible values. Note that the cardinality of the random variable's output is the same as the cardinality of the sample space it maps from. This means that a discrete random variable must describe a finite or countably infinite set.

### Probability Mass Function

The distribution of a random variable is defined using a probability mass function (PMF):

$$p(x) = Pr(X = x), \forall x \in \{x_1, x_2, ...\}$$

Side note: the $\forall$ symbol means "for all". It is saying that we can pick any $x$ which is in $\{x_1, x_2, ...\}$ and have the statement be valid.

The probability of a event (or set of outcomes) can be described using the PMF:

$$p(B) = Pr(X \in B) = \sum\limits_{x_i \in B} p(x_i)$$

for any set of real values $B$ (this means $B$ is a group of outputs from $X$, not the original sample space). However, this is equivalent to the probability of all of the outcomes in the sample space which correspond to $B$.

As with normal probability, the sum of all the probabilities of outcomes is 1:

$$Pr(X(S)) = Pr(\{x_w = X(w) | \forall w \in S\}) = \sum\limits_{X(w) = x_w, \forall w \in S} Pr(w) = Pr(S) = 1$$

A **Borel set** is an interval of real numbers which can be represented as a union, intersection, or complement. Given some Borel set $B$, we can measure its probability relative to a random variable by measuring the probability of the set of outcomes which it corresponds to:

$$Pr(X \in B) = Pr(X^{-1}(B))$$

### Cumulative Distribution Function

This is another way to describe the probability distribution of a random variable. It represents the sum of probabilities of all values below a given number $x$:

$$F(x) = Pr(X \le x), \forall x \in \mathbb{R}$$

In other words, the cumulative distribution function represents the probability that a random variable $X$ will be less than x.

~~Example: Coin CDF

Let's use the same example as earlier: A random variable $X$ is defined as 0 if the coin is a tail, and a 1 when it is a head. The CDF of X is:

$$F(x) = Pr(X \le x) = \begin{cases} 0, && x \lt 0 \\ 0.5, && 0 \le x \lt 1 \\ 1, && x \ge 1\end{cases}$$

~~

Properties of the CDF of discrete random variables:

- always increasing
- it is a step function
- $0 \le F(x) \le 1$
- $\lim\limits_{x\to -\infty} F(x)= 0$
- $\lim\limits_{x\to \infty} F(x)= 1$
- it is right-continuous (meaning as you move to the right from the last step it is continuous)

All probabilities in X can be described with the CDF:

- $Pr(X \le b) = F(b)$
- $Pr(X \gt b) = 1 - F(b)$
- $Pr(a \lt X \le b) = F(b)-F(a)$
- $Pr(X \lt b) = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} Pr(X \le b - \frac{1}{n}) = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} F(b - \frac{1}{n})$
- $Pr(X = b) = F(b) - F^-(b)$

~~Example: 

In this experiment, we are selecting 4 balls from 20 numbered ones. $X$ is defined as the largest number of the four balls. Here, the only outcomes we are concerned with are the ones with different maximums.

$$X(S) = \{4..20\}$$

What is the PMF $Pr(X = i)$?

The total number of outcomes is easy, it is simply selecting 4 from 20. On top, we know one ball is $i$, so that is already selected, and the rest are less than $i$, so there are $i-1$ balls to choose from:

$$P(X = i) = {1 *\left(\begin{array}{c}i-1 \\ 3\end{array}\right) \over \left(\begin{array}{c}20 \\ 4\end{array}\right)}$$

What is the CDF?

We could easily define the CDF in terms of the PMF:

$$F(10) = P(X \le 10) = \sum\limits_{i=4}^10 {\left(\begin{array}{c}i-1 \\ 3\end{array}\right) \over \left(\begin{array}{c}20 \\ 4\end{array}\right)}$$

But what about using counting? The outcomes where the max is less than or equal to 10 are the same as selecting four balls from the 10 which are less than or equal to 10. So, more generally:

$$F(x) = {\left(\begin{array}{c}x \\ 4\end{array}\right) \over \left(\begin{array}{c}20 \\ 4\end{array}\right)}$$
