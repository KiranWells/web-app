# Conditional Probability

Conditional probability is the probability of one event given that another is true. In this case, we are given information about the set of outcomes, which allows us to narrow the possibilities down.

For example, if we roll a die, there are six possible outcomes. However, if we already know that the result was even, then we can narrow it down to three options. This is related to the formula:

Unconditional Probability:

$$P(A[|\Omega]) = {P(A\cap \Omega) \over P(\Omega)}$$

Conditional Probability:

$$P(A|B) = {P(A\cap B) \over P(B)}$$

In normal probability, we only know the event is inside the entire space. However, when we add knowledge that $B$ is true, we can see what the probability of $A$ inside of $B$. Note that for this to make sense, $B$ must have some non-zero probability.

In addition, the probability given by $P(\cdot | B)$ is a valid measure, and satisfies all of the probability axioms (and these can be proved):

1. non-negativity: $P(A|B) \ge 0$
2. normalization: $P(B|B) = 1$
3. countable additivity: the sum of the probabilities of disjoint events is the same as the probability of their union.

One important note is that $P(A|B)$ is "the probability of A given B", whereas $P(A,B)$ is "the probability of A and B".

This idea can be used in reverse to convert normal equations into conditional statements:

$$P(A\cap B \cap C) = P(C\cap (B \cap A))$$
$$=P(A\cap B) P(C|B \cap A)$$
$$=P(A)P(B|A)P(C|B \cap A)$$

~~Example

What is the probability that no two students in a class of size n have the same birthday? Assume birthdays are evenly distributed through the 365 days of the year.

To do this, we add up the probabilities that, given one student has one day as their birthday, another student does not have the same birthday:

$${365 \over 365} * {365-1 \over 365} * {365-2 \over 365} * {365-3 \over 365} * {365-4 \over 365} * ...$$

Interestingly, this probability goes down very quickly as the number of people increases.
