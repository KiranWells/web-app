# Vector Integrals

As a review, there are three main types of functions we are dealing with:

- Paths - $\vec x(t): \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^n$
- Scalar field - $f(x,y,...): \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$
- Vector field - $\vec F(x,y,...): \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$

In addition, there are three main differentiation-like operators:

- Gradient - $\nabla f = \left({\partial f \over \partial x},{\partial f \over \partial y},{\partial f \over \partial z}\right)$
- Divergence - $\nabla \cdot \vec F = \left({\partial F_1 \over \partial x},{\partial F_2 \over \partial y},{\partial F_3 \over \partial z}\right)$
- Curl - $\nabla\times \vec F = \left(F_{3y}-F_{2z}\right)\hat i - \left(F_{3x}-F_{1z}\right) \hat j +\left(F_{2x}-F_{1y}\right)\hat k$

## Line Integrals

The definition of integrals is an infinite sum of infinitesmal parts, or in other words, splitting a range up as small as possible and adding up all of the parts:

$$\int_a^b f(x)dx = \sum\limits_{n=1}^{(b-a)\over \Delta x} \lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} {f(x + n\Delta x) * \Delta x}$$

This is important to keep in mind as we define integrals for various vector functions, starting with the line integral.

Essentially, a line integral is summing up the value of a function along a path. For this integral, the value you are integrating is the function evaluated at each point, and the differential value is the change in the position along the path.

This can be done for both scalar and vector fields.

### Scalar Line Integral

> Definition: Scalar Line Integral  
> Given a path $\vec x(t)$ and a scalar field $f(\vec p)$, where $\vec p$ is a point, the line integral of $f$ along $\vec x$ is:  
> $$\int\limits_{\vec x} f ds$$

This is essentially adding up the value of $f$ at each point multiplied by the change in length along the path:

$$
\lim\limits_{\Delta s_i \to 0}
\sum\limits_{i=1}^n f(\vec x_i^*(t))\Delta s_i
$$

If you notice, we integrate with respect to $s$, not $t$. This represents the *length* of the path, not the paramater $t$, so we need to get the length. To do this, we use the length function:

$$
L(\vec x) = \int_a^b ||\vec x'(t)||dt
$$

Getting the formula:

$$\int_a^b f(\vec x(t))||x'(t)||dt$$

~~Example 1

Given:

$$\vec x(t) = (3\cos t, 3\sin t, 4t)$$

$$f = xy + x + \frac{z}{2}$$

Calculate $\int\limits_{\vec x} fds$

The first step is to convert $f(x,y,z)$ to $f(t)$:

$$
f(\vec x(t)) = 
9\cos t\sin t + 3\cos t + 2t
$$

Now, we need the length of $\vec x$:

$$||\vec x'(t)|| = \sqrt{9\sin^2 t + 9\cos^2 t + 16} = 5$$

And we take the integral:

$$\int (9\cos t\sin t + 3\cos t + 2t)5dt$$

$$= 45\int \sin t\cos t dt + 15\int \cos t dt + 10 \int t dt$$

And using the trig identity ${\sin 2t \over 2}$ (You could also use $u$-substitution with $u=\sin t$):

$$= \frac{45}{2}\int \sin 2t dt + 15\int \cos t dt + 10 \int t dt$$

$$= -\frac{45}{4}\cos 2t + 15\sin t + \frac{10}{2}t^2$$

~~

~~Example 2: Piecewise

$$
\vec x(t) = 
\begin{cases}
(t, 2t) && 0 \le t \le 1 \\
(t, 3-t) && 1 \le t \le 3
\end{cases}
$$

$$f(x,y) = x+y$$

To integrate this from 0 to 3, we will need to integrate two separate portions.

$$\int_0^3 fds = \int_0^1 fds + \int_1^3 fds$$

So:

$$f(\vec x_1(t)) = t + 2t = 3t$$

$$||\vec x_1'(t)|| = \sqrt{1+4} = \sqrt{5}$$

$$\int_0^1 fds = \int_0^1 3t\sqrt{5} dt = \frac{3\sqrt{5}}{2}$$

$$f(\vec x_2(t)) = t + 3-t = 3$$

$$||\vec x_2'(t)|| = \sqrt{1+1} = \sqrt{2}$$

$$\int_1^3 fds = \int_1^3 3\sqrt{2} dt = 6\sqrt{2}$$
