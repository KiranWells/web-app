# Vector Integrals

As a review, there are three main types of functions we are dealing with:

- Paths - $\vec x(t): \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^n$
- Scalar field - $f(x,y,...): \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$
- Vector field - $\vec F(x,y,...): \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$

In addition, there are three main differentiation-like operators:

- Gradient - $\nabla f = \left({\partial f \over \partial x},{\partial f \over \partial y},{\partial f \over \partial z}\right)$
- Divergence - $\nabla \cdot \vec F = \left({\partial F_1 \over \partial x},{\partial F_2 \over \partial y},{\partial F_3 \over \partial z}\right)$
- Curl - $\nabla\times \vec F = \left(F_{3y}-F_{2z}\right)\hat i - \left(F_{3x}-F_{1z}\right) \hat j +\left(F_{2x}-F_{1y}\right)\hat k$

## Line Integrals

The definition of integrals is an infinite sum of infinitesimal parts, or in other words, splitting a range up as small as possible and adding up all of the parts:

$$\int_a^b f(x)dx = \sum\limits_{n=1}^{(b-a)\over \Delta x} \lim\limits_{\Delta x \to 0} {f(x + n\Delta x) * \Delta x}$$

This is important to keep in mind as we define integrals for various vector functions, starting with the line integral.

Essentially, a line integral is summing up the value of a function along a path. For this integral, the value you are integrating is the function evaluated at each point, and the differential value is the change in the position along the path.

This can be done for both scalar and vector fields.

### Scalar Line Integral

> Definition: Scalar Line Integral  
> Given a path $\vec x(t)$ and a scalar field $f(\vec p)$, where $\vec p$ is a point, the line integral of $f$ along $\vec x$ is:  
> $$\int\limits_{\vec x} f ds$$

This is essentially adding up the value of $f$ at each point multiplied by the change in length along the path:

$$
\lim\limits_{\Delta s_i \to 0}
\sum\limits_{i=1}^n f(\vec x_i^*(t))\Delta s_i
$$

If you notice, we integrate with respect to $s$, not $t$. This represents the *length* of the path, not the parameter $t$, so we need to get the length. To do this, we use the length function:

$$
L(\vec x) = \int_a^b ||\vec x'(t)||dt
$$

Getting the formula:

$$\int_a^b f(\vec x(t))||x'(t)||dt$$

~~Example 1

Given:

$$\vec x(t) = (3\cos t, 3\sin t, 4t)$$

$$f = xy + x + \frac{z}{2}$$

Calculate $\int\limits_{\vec x} fds$

The first step is to convert $f(x,y,z)$ to $f(t)$:

$$
f(\vec x(t)) = 
9\cos t\sin t + 3\cos t + 2t
$$

Now, we need the length of $\vec x$:

$$||\vec x'(t)|| = \sqrt{9\sin^2 t + 9\cos^2 t + 16} = 5$$

And we take the integral:

$$\int (9\cos t\sin t + 3\cos t + 2t)5dt$$

$$= 45\int \sin t\cos t dt + 15\int \cos t dt + 10 \int t dt$$

And using the trig identity ${\sin 2t \over 2}$ (You could also use $u$-substitution with $u=\sin t$):

$$= \frac{45}{2}\int \sin 2t dt + 15\int \cos t dt + 10 \int t dt$$

$$= -\frac{45}{4}\cos 2t + 15\sin t + \frac{10}{2}t^2$$

~~

~~Example 2: Piecewise

$$
\vec x(t) = 
\begin{cases}
(t, 2t) && 0 \le t \le 1 \\
(t, 3-t) && 1 \le t \le 3
\end{cases}
$$

$$f(x,y) = x+y$$

To integrate this from 0 to 3, we will need to integrate two separate portions.

$$\int_0^3 fds = \int_0^1 fds + \int_1^3 fds$$

So:

$$f(\vec x_1(t)) = t + 2t = 3t$$

$$||\vec x_1'(t)|| = \sqrt{1+4} = \sqrt{5}$$

$$\int_0^1 fds = \int_0^1 3t\sqrt{5} dt = \frac{3\sqrt{5}}{2}$$

$$f(\vec x_2(t)) = t + 3-t = 3$$

$$||\vec x_2'(t)|| = \sqrt{1+1} = \sqrt{2}$$

$$\int_1^3 fds = \int_1^3 3\sqrt{2} dt = 6\sqrt{2}$$

~~

### Vector Line Integrals

A vector line integral integrates a vector field along a path. Instead of using a scalar $ds$, being the length, we use a vector $d\vec s$, the *vector* change in the path.

This has a useful physical application: work, along with many other physical quantities, are defined as the sum of the force along a displacement. This means we want to integrate a force vector field over a path traveled.

> Definition: Vector Line Integrals  
> The vector line integral is given by:  
> $$\int\limits_{\vec x} \vec F \cdot d\vec s$$

The formula for computing this also uses the path equation to convert the elements into terms of $t$:

$$\int\limits_{\vec x} \vec F \cdot d\vec s = \int\limits_a^b \vec F(\vec x(t)) \cdot \vec x'(t)dt$$

Notice how here we do not have to take the length of the $d\vec s$ vector to convert it to a scalar.

~~Example: vector line integral

Given:

$$\vec F = (x, e^y, x +z)$$

and $\vec x$ is the line segment from $(0,1,0)$ to $(2,3,4)$, calculate the line integral along the path.

Since the question does not give a function for $\vec x$, we need to do it ourselves. This is called **parameterization**.

In this case, it is just the line equation from the first point to the second point:

$$\vec x = (0,1,0) + t((2,3,4) - (0,1,0))$$
$$\vec x = (0,1,0) + t(2,2,4), t \in [0,1]$$
$$\vec x' = (2,2,4)$$

Then we can do the integral:

$$\int \vec F \cdot d\vec s = \int_0^1 \vec F(\vec x) \cdot \vec x'$$
$$= \int_0^1 (2t, e^{1+2t}, 2t + 4t) \cdot (2,2,4)dt$$
$$= \int_0^1 4t + 2e^{1+2t} + 24t dt$$
$$= \int_0^1 28t + 2e^{1+2t} dt$$
$$= 14t^2 + e^{1+2t} |_0^1$$
$$= 14 + e^3-e$$

~~

There is an alternate formula, called **differential form**. 

Given:

$$\vec F = (F_1, F_2, F_3)$$
$$\vec x(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))$$

$$\int \vec F \cdot \vec x'$$
$$\int (F_1, F_2, F_3) \cdot (x'(t), y'(t), z'(t))$$
$$\int F_1 x'(t) +  F_2 y'(t) + F_3 z'(t)$$
$$= \int F_1dx + \int F_2 dy + \int F_3 dz$$

From here, you will need to plug in the equation for $\vec x$ to convert to an integral in $t$.

~~Example: alternate formula

Given:

$$\vec F = (x+y, y+z, z+x)$$

$$\vec x = (t, t^2, t^3)$$

$$\int \vec F \cdot d\vec s = \int F_1dx + \int F_2dy + \int F_3dz$$

$$\int (x+y)dx + \int (y+z)dy + \int (x+z)dz$$

This makes more sense once we plug in the equation for $\vec x$

$$= \int_0^1 (t + t^2)dt + \int_0^1 (t^2 + t^3)2tdt + \int_0^1 (t + t^3)3t^2 dt$$

Which after integration gives:

$$\frac{17}{6}$$
