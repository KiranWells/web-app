# Vectors and Vector Fields

The following sections cover vector calculus and are mostly focused on just vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$. In addition, notation will change slightly:

$$
e_1 = 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
1 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{array}
\right),
e_2 = 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
0 \\ 1 \\ 0
\end{array}
\right),
e_3 = 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
0 \\ 0 \\ 1
\end{array}
\right)
$$

Will become:

$$\hat i, \hat j, \hat k$$

This means that writing vectors will look like:

$$\vec x = x_1 \hat i + x_2 \hat j + x_3 \hat k$$

And a final note on notation: vectors and vector-valued functions will usually be denoted with an arrow symbol on top: $\vec x(t)$ for $\vec F$. In addition, I will often use $f_x$ to represent $\partial f \over \partial x$.

## Review - Dot Product

In this section, we will need to make use of the dot/scalar product:

$$x^Ty = x \cdot y = x_1y_1 + x_2 y_2 + x_3 y_3$$

And we can tell if vectors are perpendicular by this:

$$x \perp y \to x\cdot y = 0$$

Or we can find the angle between them:

$$x\cdot y = ||x||||y||\cos\theta$$

And find the projection of $x$ on $y$:

$$proj_y x = {x\cdot y \over ||y||^2}y$$

## Cross Product

In addition to the dot product, we will need the cross product, which represents the vector which is perpendicular to both vectors:

$$a \times b = c\ |\ a \perp c, b \perp c$$

The direction is determined by the right hand rule, where you can take your right hand, curl your fingers from $a$ to $b$, and the direction of your thumb will be the direction of $c$.

The length of $a \times b$ is equal to the area of the parallelogram with sides $a$ and $b$. This comes out to be:

$$|| a \times b || = ||a|| ||b|| \sin \theta$$

Where $\theta$ is the angle between them.

### Calculation

To actually compute this vector, we use a determinant definition:

$$a \times b = \begin{vmatrix} \hat i && \hat j && \hat k \\ a_1 && a_2 && a_3 \\ b_1 && b_2 && b_3 \end{vmatrix}$$

$$=(a_2b_3 - b_2a_3)\hat i - (a_1b_3 - b_1a_3)\hat j + (a_1b_2 - a_2b_1)\hat k$$

~~Example 1

$$a = (1,3,-2)$$
$$b = (2,0,2)$$

$$a \times b = \begin{vmatrix} \hat i && \hat j && \hat k \\ 1 && 3 && -2 \\ 2 && 0 && 2 \end{vmatrix}$$

$$=6\hat i - 6\hat j - 6\hat k$$

$$=(6, -6, -6)$$

~~

### Properties

1. $$\begin{cases} i \times j = k \\ j \times k = i \\ k \times i = j\end{cases}$$
2. $$a\times b = -b\times a$$
3. $$(a + b)\times c = a\times c + b\times c$$
4. $$a\times (b+c) = a\times b + a\times c$$
5. $$\alpha(a\times b) = (\alpha a)\times b = a\times (\alpha b)$$
#### Warning:
6. $$(a\times b)\times c \ne a\times(b\times c)$$

### Application

~~Example: Equation of a plane

Write the equation of the plane going through the points $A(1,0,1)$, $B(2,3,4)$, $C(-1,-1,1)$.

To do this, we need the normal of the plane, which is a vector perpendicular to the plane. Since we have three points, we can construct two vectors in the plane and take their cross product to get the nromal vector:

$$\vec{AB} = (1,3,3), \vec{AC} = (-2,-1,0)$$

$$N = (1,3,3)\times (-2,-1,0)$$

$$=\begin{vmatrix} \hat i && \hat j && \hat k \\ 1 && 3 && 3 \\ -2 && -1 && 0 \end{vmatrix}$$

$$N = (3,-6,5)$$

Now, to get the equation, we express it as any point which is perpendicular to the normal. Then we translate it so the equation passes through a point on the plane:

$$(3,-6,5)\perp (x-1, y-0, z-1)$$

$$3(x-1)-6y+5(z-1)=0$$

~~

~~Example: Paths in vector space

Given a line through the point $b$ and has the same direction as vector $a$, find an equation for the line.

To do this, we consider $b$ as the start and describe every point on the line as a scalar offset in the direction of $a$.

$$\vec x(t) = \vec b + t\vec a$$

Note: vector symbols added here for clarity.

~~

### Paths in $\mathbb{R}^n$

A path in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a continuous function $\vec x$ over the interval $I$ contained in $\mathbb{R}^n$. In less mathematical terms, we can represent each of the coordinates of $\vec x$ at a parameterized location as a continuous function of those parameters.

For example, a curve will look like this:

$$
\vec x(t) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
f(t) \\ g(t) \\ h(t)
\end{array}
\right)
$$

And a surface could look like:

$$
\vec S(u,v) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
f(u,v) \\ g(u,v) \\ h(u,v)
\end{array}
\right)
$$

~~Example: Circles and helixes

A circle can be defined as a path by taking the coordinates for each point on the line:

$$
\vec p(t) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
x(t) \\ y(t)
\end{array}
\right)
$$
$$
\vec p(t) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
R\cos t \\ R\sin t
\end{array}
\right)
$$

A similar path in 3D is a helix:

$$
\vec p(t) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
R\cos t \\ R\sin t \\ \alpha t
\end{array}
\right)
$$

~~

#### Velocity and Acceleration

> Definition: Path velocity and acceleration  
> Given a path $x(t) = (x_1(t), x_2(t), x_3(t))$, the velocity is defined as:  
> $$x'(t) = (x_1'(t), x_2'(t), x_3'(t))$$  
> And the acceleration is defined as:  
> $$x''(t) = (x_1''(t), x_2''(t), x_3''(t))$$

Note that the velocity is in the direction of the tangent line. So, we can define the formula for the tangent line at $x_0 = x(t_0)$ as:

$$\vec l(t) = \vec x_0 + \vec x'(t_0)(t-t_0)$$

This is just the equation for a line starting at the point $x_0$ at the time $t_0$ and moving in the direction of $x'(t_0)$.

#### Length

> Definition: Arc Length  
> The arc length of a path $x(t)$ on the interval $[a,b]$ is defined as:  
> $$L(x) = \int_a^b ||x'(t)||dt$$

This definition makes sense, as it is very similar to the formula for the length of a curve in normal calculus.

~~Example: Path Length

Given:

$$x(t) = (R\cos t, R\sin t)$$

$$t \in [0, 2\pi]$$

Find the length of the arc.

$$x'(t) = (-R\sin t, R\cos t)$$

$$||x'(t)|| = \sqrt{R^2\sin^2 t + R^2\cos^2 t}$$
$$=R$$

$$L(x) = \int_0^{2\pi} Rdt$$
$$=Rt|_0^{2\pi}$$
$$=2\pi R$$

Which is the circumference of a circle.

~~

## Vector Fields

Vector fields are a group of vectors covering a space, where each point $r$ has a certain vector associated with it. For example, the gravitational force creates a vector field:

$$\vec F = G{m_1m_2\over ||\vec r||^2}\hat r$$

> Definition: Vector Fields  
> A vector field on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a mapping:
> $$F: x\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$$

~~Example: Vector Fields

1. $$F(x) = \hat j = (0,1)$$

This is a field which has the same value for every point, similar to the flow of a fluid straight down a pipe.

2. $$F(x) = x$$

Here, the output is the same as the input. This could represent a force which is stronger the farther you get from it.

~~

### Scalar Fields

This is the same as a vector field, but the output is a scalar:

$$F(\vec x) \to \alpha (\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$$

## Derivatives

### Del operator

To help define derivatives in vector fields, we use the **del operator**:

$$\nabla = \hat i {\partial \over \partial x} + \hat j {\partial \over \partial y} + \hat k {\partial \over \partial z}$$

This takes the partial derivative of a vector which is multiplied by it, and can be used to define three versions of differentiation:

1. Gradient: $\nabla f$ - multiply a scalar field $f$ by $\nabla$
2. Divergence: $\nabla \cdot F$ - dot product of a vector field $F$ by $\nabla$
3. Curl: $\nabla \times F$ - cross product of a vector field $F$ by $\nabla$

### Gradient

> Definition:  
> The gradient of a function is defined as:  
> $$\nabla f = ({\partial f \over \partial x}, {\partial f \over \partial y}, {\partial f \over \partial z})$$

Note that the gradient of a scalar function is a vector function. 

~~Example: Gradient

$$f(x,y,z) = xyz + 2x$$

$$\nabla f = (yz + 2, xz, xy)$$

~~

### Divergence

> Definition:  
> The divergence of a vector field $F$ is defined as:  
> $$F(x,y,z) = (F_1(x,y,z), F_2(...), F_3(...))$$  
> $$\nabla \cdot F = ({\partial F_1 \over \partial x}, {\partial F_2 \over \partial y}, {\partial F_3 \over \partial z})$$

Note that the divergence of a vector field is a scalar field. In addition, it represents the amount of "flow" into or out of a point.

~~Example: Divergence

$$F(x,y) =x\hat i + y\hat j$$

$$\nabla \cdot F = {\partial \over \partial x}x + {\partial \over \partial y}y = 1 + 1 = 2$$

If instead, we had:

$$F(x,y) = y\hat i + x \hat j$$

The divergence would be 0:

$$\nabla \cdot F = {\partial \over \partial x}y + {\partial \over \partial y}x = 0 + 0 = 0$$

If you graphed this, it would represent a radial field where there is no net in-flow or out-flow.

~~

### Curl

> Definition:  
> The divergence of a vector field is given by:
> $$curl\ \vec F = \nabla \times \vec F$$

This simplifies down to:

$$
curl\ \vec F = 
\begin{vmatrix}
\hat i && \hat j && \hat k \\
{\partial \over \partial x} && {\partial \over \partial y} && {\partial \over \partial z} \\
F_1 && F_2 && F_3
\end{vmatrix}
$$
$$
curl\ \vec F = 
\left({\partial F_3 \over \partial y}-{\partial F_2 \over \partial z}\right)\hat i - 
\left({\partial F_3 \over \partial x}-{\partial F_1 \over \partial z}\right) \hat j +
\left({\partial F_2 \over \partial x}-{\partial F_1 \over \partial y}\right)\hat k
$$

Which, written in simplified notation (${\partial F_1 \over \partial x} = F_{1x}$):

$$
curl\ \vec F = 
\left(F_{3y}-F_{2z}\right)\hat i - 
\left(F_{3x}-F_{1z}\right) \hat j +
\left(F_{2x}-F_{1y}\right)\hat k
$$

Curl represents the "twisting" or rotation of the vector field; or the amount of movement not in a diverging or converging direction. If you think about it in polar coordinates, divergence is in the $\hat r$ direction, and curl is in the $\hat \theta$ direction.

~~Example: Curl

Given:

$$\vec F = (2xy, y+z, x^2+y^2+z^2)$$

Find the divergence and curl.

$$div\ \vec F = ({\partial F_1 \over \partial x}, {\partial F_2 \over \partial y}, {\partial F_3 \over \partial z})$$
$$div\ \vec F = (2y, 1, 2z)$$

$$curl\ \vec F = (2y-1)\hat i - (2x)\hat j + (-2x)\hat k$$
$$curl\ \vec F = (2y-1,-2x,-2x)$$

~~

Because of these properties of curl and divergence, we can use them to descibe fields:

If curl is 0, $\vec F$ is **irrotational**.

If divergence is 0, $\vec F$ is **incompressible**.

## Interactions Between the Operators

> Theorem 1:  
> If $f$ is twice differentiable, then $curl(\nabla f) = 0$.

~~Proof 1

By definition:

$$\nabla f = \left({\partial f \over \partial x},{\partial f \over \partial y},{\partial f \over \partial z}\right)$$

$$
curl(\nabla f) = 
\begin{vmatrix}
\hat i && \hat j && \hat k \\
{\partial \over \partial x} && {\partial \over \partial y} && {\partial \over \partial z} \\
f_x && f_y && f_z
\end{vmatrix}
$$

$$=(f_{yz} - f_{zy})\hat i - (f_{xz} - f_{zx})\hat j + (f_{xy} - f_{yx})\hat j$$

Because of the properties of partial differentiation, $f_{xy} = f_{yx}$. Therefore, all of these values are $0$.

~~

> Theorem 2:  
> If $\vec F$ is a twice differentiable vector field, $div(curl(\vec F)) = 0$.

~~Proof 2

$$
curl\vec F = 
\begin{vmatrix}
\hat i && \hat j && \hat k \\
{\partial \over \partial x} && {\partial \over \partial y} && {\partial \over \partial z} \\
F_1 && F_2 && F_3
\end{vmatrix}
$$

$$=
\left(F_{3y}-F_{2z}\right)\hat i - 
\left(F_{3x}-F_{1z}\right) \hat j +
\left(F_{2x}-F_{1y}\right)\hat k
$$

and taking the divergence:

$$
div(curl(\vec F)) = 
{\partial \over \partial x}
\left(F_{3y}-F_{2z}\right) - 
{\partial \over \partial y}
\left(F_{3x}-F_{1z}\right) +
{\partial \over \partial z}
\left(F_{2x}-F_{1y}\right)
$$

$$
div(curl(\vec F)) = 
F_{3yx}-F_{2zx} - 
F_{3xy}+F_{1zy} +
F_{2xz}-F_{1yz}
$$

Which again using the property that $F_{xy} = F_{yx}$, leads to $0$.
