# Stokes' and Gauss's Theorems

## Introduction

Before we get into the theorems, there are a couple of important topics to cover

### Orientation

Given some surface, the normal vector will be pointing perpendicular to the surface, normally up. However, if you use a different parameterization, sometimes the direction will flip.

The direction that the normal vector faces with respect to the surface is the **orientaion**. It was not terribly important before, but for these two theorem, we will need to specify the orientation of the surfaces. If you get a normal which is in the opposite orientation, you just need to flip the sign of the integral.

Generally, the **right-hand rule** is used to determine orientation, where the normal vector is pointed up and the direction of integration around a boundary is counter-clockwise.

## Stokes' Theorem

This connects a surface integral to a path integral.

> Theorem:  
> Given an oriented surface $\vec S$ (with some limitations which will not come into play in this course), and $\partial S$ as its boundary, oriented according to the right-hand rule, then:  
> $$\iint\limits_S \nabla \times \vec F \cdot d\vec S = \oint\limits_{\partial S} \vec F \cdot d\vec s$$

~~Example: Stokes Theorem

Given the surface $S$ as the graph of $z = 9 - x^2 - y^2$ where $z \ge 0$ (oriented upward) and $\vec F = (2z - y, x+z, 3x-2y)$ find both sides of the Stokes' Theorem.

First, we need $\partial S$, which is just the function when $z = 0$:

$$\partial S = {z = 0, x^2 + y^2 = 9}$$

Then, we can start from the left side of Stokes Theorem:

$$\iint\limits_S \nabla \times \vec F \cdot d\vec S$$

Which requires the curl of $\vec F$:

$$\nabla \times \vec F = ... = (-3,-1,2)$$

Next, we can use the formula for the special case to get $\vec N$:

$$\vec N = \left(-{\partial g \over \partial s}, -{\partial g \over \partial t}, 1\right) = (2s,2t,1)$$

Additionally, we need to specify the region of $(s,t)$ that $S$ is over. In this case, it is the circle of $x$ and $y$ that the function covers, meaning we can define it in polar coordinates:

$$D = 0 \le r \le 3, 0\le\theta\le 2\pi$$

And then plug in:

$$\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^3 (-3,-1,2) \cdot (2(r\cos\theta), 2(r\sin\theta), 1) rdrd\theta$$

Note that we add an $r$ ($rdrd\theta$) when changing to polar coordinates.

Which will give $18\pi$.

Second, we can compute the line integral (right side):

$$\oint\limits_{\partial S} \vec F \cdot d\vec s$$

The path we have is:

$$\partial S = {z = 0, x^2 + y^2 = 9}$$
$$\vec x(t) = (3\cos t, 3\sin t, 0)$$

So we have:

$$\int_0^{2\pi} \vec F(\vec x(t))\cdot \vec x'(t) dt$$

Which can be computed much more simply.

~~

### Another Application

If we have two surfaces with the same boundary, we can use this equation to prove that the surface integrals (of the curl) will be equal.

$$\partial S_1 = \partial S_2$$

$$\iint\limits_{S_1} \nabla \times \vec F \cdot d\vec S_1 = \oint\limits_{\partial S_1} \vec F \cdot d\vec s =\oint\limits_{\partial S_2} \vec F \cdot d\vec s = \iint\limits_{S_2} \nabla \times \vec F \cdot d\vec S_2$$

## Gauss's Theorem

This connects a surface integral to a 3D integral.

> Theorem:  
> Given a solid region $D$, with $\partial D$ being the closed surface containing it (oriented outward), then:  
> $$\oint\limits_{\partial D} \vec F\cdot d\vec S = \iiint\limits_D \nabla \cdot \vec F dV$$

### Application: Volume

If we select a vector field such that $\nabla \cdot \vec F = 1$, then the integral becomes:

$$\oint\limits_{\partial D} \vec F\cdot d\vec S = \iiint\limits_D 1 dV$$

Which will give the volume of the region. Choices of $\vec F$ which satisfy this include:

$$
\vec F = \begin{cases}
(\frac{x}{3}, \frac{y}{3}, \frac{z}{3}) \\
(x, 0 ,0) \\
(0,y,0) \\
(0,0,z)
\end{cases}
$$

### Application: Zero Integrals

If $\nabla \cdot \vec F = 0$, then the triple integral is $0$, so we have:

$$\oint\limits_{\partial D} \vec F \cdot d\vec S = 0$$

~~Example: Zero Integrals

Given:

$$S \to z = e^{4-x^2-y^2}, z\le 1$$

(oriented upward)

$$\vec F = (x,y,2,2z)$$

Calculate $\iint\limits_S \vec F \cdot d\vec S$.

In this case, if we take the divergence of $\vec F$, we get:

$$\nabla \cdot \vec F = 1 + 1 - 2 = 0$$

So, if we combine the surface we have with the base of the surface, we get:

$$\iint\limits_S \vec F \cdot d\vec S + \iint\limits_{S_{base}} \vec F \cdot d\vec S_{base} = \iiint\limits_D 0dV$$

Which allows us to compute the surface integral given as the negative integral of the base surface.

Note in this case that this is an equivalent effect to noting that these surfaces have the same boundaries, as signs and orientation will cancel out.
