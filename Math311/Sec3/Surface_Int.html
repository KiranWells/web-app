# Surface Integrals

## Introduction

Surface integrals are very similar to line integrals: we will be integrating a function over a parameterized equation for the surface. However, the parameterized function will have two arguments, normally denoted $S = \vec X(s, t)$ or $\vec X(u,v)$. 

## Parameterization

To be able to compute the surface integral, we will need a parameterization of the surface. This means some equation of the form:

$$\vec X(s,t) = (x(s,t), y(s,t), z(s,t))$$

There are many different methods for doing this.

~~Example 1: Plane

Create a parameterized equation for a plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$ going through the point $(1,2,1)$ and containing $(-1,-1,2)$ and $(-1,-1,0)$.

In this case, we can use the vectors in the plane to define all of the points on the plane relative to the anchor point. Each point can be represented as a linear combination of the two vectors, displaced from the point (similar to coordinates):

$$\vec X(s,t) = (1,2,1) + s(-1,-1,2) + t(-1, -1,0)$$

In general, the parameterization of a plane passing through $\vec p$ and containing $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ is:

$$\vec X(s,t) = \vec p + s\vec u + t\vec v$$

~~

~~Example 2: Sphere

The equation for a sphere is often given as:

$$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R^2$$

But we need a parameterized function. One way to do this is to use polar coordinates:

$$\vec X(\theta, \phi) = (R\cos \theta \sin \phi, R\sin \theta\sin\phi, R\cos\phi), \theta \in [0,2\pi], \phi \in [0,\pi]$$

And for simplicity, $\theta, \phi$ can be renamed $s,t$, or $u,v$. This may be the reason that this type of sphere is named a "UV-Sphere" in 3D modeling.

If we wanted only the top half of the sphere, we could restrict $\phi$ to $[0,\frac{\pi}{2}]$.

~~

~~Example 3: Open Cylinder

Since we don't have to include the top and bottom, we only need to consider a circle extended to height $H$. Since a circle can be marked as $x = R\cos s, y=R\sin s$, we get:

$$\vec X(s,t) = (R\cos s, R\sin s, t), s \in [0,2\pi], t\in [0,H]$$

~~

~~Example 4: Function

If we have a surface with an equation $z = f(x,y)$, we can easily parameterize this surface as:

$$\vec X(s,t) = (s,t,f(x=s,y=t))$$

~~

### Tangent Plane and Normal Vector

Find the tangent plane at the point $\vec X(s_0,t_0)$ on a surface $S = \vec X(s,t)$.

To get the plane, we need a point and two vectors. We already have a point, so the only thing missing is the vectors. To get these, we can get the tangent vectors at that point in the $s$ and $t$ direction by taking the partial derivative of the surface.

$$\vec T_s = {\partial \vec X \over \partial s}(s_0, t_0)$$
$$\vec T_t = {\partial \vec X \over \partial t}(s_0, t_0)$$

Now that we have the vectors, we can find the plane as a parametric function:

$$\vec P(u,v) = \vec X(s_0,t_0) + u\vec T_s + v\vec T_t$$

or the standard equation:

$$\vec N = \vec T_s \times \vec T_t$$

$$N \cdot ((x,y,z) - \vec X(s_0, t_0)) = 0$$

~~Example 5: Tangent Plane to Cylinder

$$\vec X(s,t) = (2\cos(s), 2\sin(s),t)$$

$$0\le s\le2\pi, 0\le t\le 4$$

Find an equation for the tangent plane at $\vec X(0,2) = (2,0,2)$

First, we need to find the partial derivatives:

$${\partial \vec X \over \partial s} = (-2\sin s, 2\cos s, 0)$$
$${\partial \vec X \over \partial t} = (0,0,1)$$

Evaluated at $(s_0, t_0)$, we get:

$$\vec T_s = (0, 2, 0)$$
$$\vec T_t = (0, 0, 1)$$

Then, taking the cross product to find the normal:

$$\vec N = \vec T_s \times \vec T_t$$
$$\vec N = (2-0)\hat i + (0)\hat j + (0)\hat k = 2\hat i$$

The equation is:

$$N \cdot ((x,y,z) - \vec X(s_0, t_0)) = 0$$
$$(2,0,0) \cdot (x-2,y,z-2) = 0$$
$$2(x-2) = 0$$

Or

$$x = 2$$

~~

## Surface Area

Instead of using the arc length, like with line integrals, with a surface integral we are integrating over the area, which is given by:

$$\iint\limits_D ||\vec N||dsdt$$

Or

$$\iint\limits_D ||\vec T_s \times \vec T_t||dsdt$$

~~Example 6: Surface area of a sphere

Given:

$$\vec X(s,t) = (R\sin t\cos s, R\sin t \sin s, R\sin t)$$

$$0 \le s \le 2\pi, 0 \le t \le \pi$$

Find the surface area.

First, taking the partial derivatives:

$$\vec T_s = {\partial \vec X \over \partial s} = (-R\sin t\sin s, R\sin t\cos s, 0)$$
$$\vec T_s = {\partial \vec X \over \partial t} = (R\cos t\cos s, R\cos t\sin s, -R\sin t)$$

Then, the cross product (after a lot of simplification):

$$\vec T_s \times\vec T_t = ... = (-R^2\sin^2 t\cos s, -R^2\sin^2 t \sin s, -R^2\sin t \cos t)$$

And taking the length:

$$||\vec N|| = ... = R^2\sin t$$

And now we can take the integral over the whole surface:

$$
\int\limits_0^{\pi} \int\limits_0^{2\pi} R^2 \sin (t)dsdt
$$
$$
\int\limits_0^{\pi} 2\pi R^2\sin (t)dt
$$
$$=4\pi R^2$$

~~

## Calculating the integral

In the last section, we already demonstrated how to integrate a simple integral, where the function resulted in the surface area. To do a surface integral, we will just need to integrate a more complex function.

### Scalar Surface Integral

> Definition: Scalar Surface Integral
> The integral of a function $f$ over a surface $S$ is:   
> $$\iint\limits_{\vec X} fdS = \iint\limits_D f(\vec X) ||\vec T_s \times \vec T_t|| dsdt$$

~~Example 7: Closed Cylinder

Integrate the scalar function

$$f(x,y,z) = z$$

Over the closed cylinder with radius $3$ and height $5$.

First, we need to get a parameterization of the surface. This will require splitting into three parts: the top, bottom, and side.

For the top and bottom, we can take all of the circles from radius 0 to 3 at the top or at the bottom.

$$
S = 
\begin{cases}
  \vec X_{side} = (3\cos s, 3\sin s, t), s \in [0,2\pi], t\in [0,5] \\
  \vec X_{top} = (s\cos t, s\sin t, 5), s \in [0,3], t\in [0, 2\pi] \\
  \vec X_{bottom} = (s\cos t, s\sin t, 0), s \in [0,3], t\in [0, 2\pi] \\
\end{cases}
$$

Now, we need to take the integral for each part, and sum them up. First, let's get the normal vector.

$$
\vec N_1 = (-3\sin s, 3\cos s, 0) \times (0,0,1)
$$
$$
\vec N_1 = (3\cos s)\hat i + (3\sin s) \hat j
$$

$$||\vec N_1|| = 3$$

Then take the integral:

$$\int_0^5\int_0^{2\pi} f(\vec X) ||\vec N|| dsdt$$
$$\int_0^5\int_0^{2\pi} t 3 dsdt$$
$$\int_0^5 6\pi t dt$$
$$75\pi$$

And for the bottom:

$$\iint f(\vec X)||\vec N||dsdt = \iint (0) ||\vec N||dsdt = 0$$

And the top:

$$\iint f(\vec X)||\vec N||dsdt = \int_0^{2\pi}int_0^3 (5) ||\vec N||dsdt$$

$$\vec N = (\cos t, \sin t, 0) \times (-s\sin t, s\cos t, 0)$$
$$= ... = (0,0,s)$$
$$||\vec N|| = s$$

And plug in:

$$\int_0^{2\pi}int_0^3 (5) s dsdt$$
$$= 45\pi$$

So the total is:

$$75\pi + 0 + 45\pi = 120\pi$$

~~

### Vector Surface Integral

> Definition: Scalar Surface Integral
> The integral of a function $f$ over a surface $S$ is:   
> $$\iint\limits_{\vec X} \vec F\cdot d\vec S = \iint\limits_D \vec F(\vec X) \cdot (\vec T_s \times \vec T_t) dsdt$$

~~Example 8: Vector Surface Integral

Given:

$$\vec S = \vec X(s,t) = (s\cos(t),s\sin(t),t)$$
$$0\le s \le 1, 0\le t \le 2\pi$$

$$\vec F = (x, y, z-2x)$$

Compute $\iint\limits_{\vec X}\vec F \cdot d\vec S$.

First, getting the normal vector:

$$\vec T_s = (\cos(t), \sin(t), 0)$$
$$\vec T_t = (-s\sin(t), s\cos(t), 1)$$

$$\vec N = \vec T_s \times \vec T_t = (\sin(t), -\cos(t),s)$$

Then plug in $\vec X$ too $\vec F$ and plug in:

$$\int_0^1\int_0^{2\pi} (s\cos(t), s\sin(t),t-2s\sin(t)) \cdot (\sin(t),-\cos(t),s)dsdt$$
$$\int_0^1\int_0^{2\pi} ts-2s^2\cos(t) dsdt$$

Which after integrating gives $\pi^2$

~~

### Special Case: Function

If we have a surface given by:

$$z = g(x,y)$$

Then we can parameterize this as normal with:

$$\vec X(s,t) = (s,t,g(s,t))$$

And the normal vector is:

$$\vec T_s = (1,0,{\partial g \over \partial s})$$
$$\vec T_t = (0,1,{\partial g \over \partial t})$$

$$\vec N = (-{\partial g \over \partial s}, -{\partial g \over \partial t}, 1)$$

And the integral becomes:

$$\iint \vec F(s,t,g(s,t)) \cdot (-{\partial g \over \partial s}, -{\partial g \over \partial t}, 1) dsdt$$
