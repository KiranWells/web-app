# Line Integrals, Continued

## Green Theorem

Integrating over a closed path leads to a specific special case where line integrals are easier to compute.

Given a closed region $D$ in two dimensions bounded by a path $C = \partial D$, where $C$ is assumed to contain finitely many curves and does not self-intersect, along with a couple of other assumptions, the line integral can be given by:

$$\oint\limits_C \vec F \cdot d\vec s = \iint\limits_D \left({\partial F_2 \over \partial x} - {\partial F_1 \over \partial y}\right)dA$$

For this to work, $C$ must be oriented so that the direction of integration always keeps the enclosed region $D$ on the left. (Note: $\oint$ indicates the integral is over a closed path.)

~~Example: Green Theorem

Compute both sides of Green's Theorem for the area bounded by $y=x$ and $y=x^2$ for $\vec F = (xy, y^2)$.

$$\oint\limits_C \vec F \cdot d\vec s = \iint\limits_D \left({\partial F_2 \over \partial x} - {\partial F_1 \over \partial y}\right)dA$$

First, let's compute the line integral:

$$\oint\limits_C \vec F \cdot d\vec s = \int\limits_{\vec x_1} \vec F\cdot d\vec s + \int\limits_{\vec x_2} \vec F\cdot d\vec s$$

We also need to parameterize the paths. In the case of $y=x^2$ it is easy, as we can simply set $t=y$ and create the path that way:

$$\vec x_1 = (t,t^2)$$

For the other line we must make sure to follow the direction we need to integrate in, so instead of $(t,t)$, we move from $(1,1)$ to $(0,0)$, giving:

$$\vec x_2 = (1-t, 1-t)$$

$$\int\limits_{\vec x_1} \vec F\cdot d\vec s = \int_0^1 (t^3, t^4)\cdot (1,2t)dt$$
$$\int\limits_{\vec x_2} \vec F\cdot d\vec s = \int_0^1 ((1-t)^2, (1-t)^2)\cdot (-1,-1)dt$$

This gives $-\frac{1}{12}$.

Next, we do the surface integral. We are integrating over the area between $y=x^2$ and $y=x$, and $x\in [0,1]$. So we get:

$$\iint\limits_D \left({\partial F_2 \over \partial x} - {\partial F_1 \over \partial y}\right)dA = \int_0^1\int_{x^2}^{x} (0 - x)dydx$$
$$=\int_0^1 (-xy |_{y=x^2}^{y=x}) dx$$
$$=\int_0^1 -x(x - x^2) dx$$
$$=-\frac{x^3}{3}|_0^1 + \frac{x^4}{4}|0^1 = -\frac{1}{12}$$

This shows that the theorem holds for this example, and it can be shown to hold for all cases satisfying the assumptions above.

### Applications

#### Area

If $\vec F$ satisfies $\left({\partial F_2 \over \partial x} - {\partial F_1 \over \partial y}\right) = 1$, then the integral becomes 

$$\iint\limits_D 1dA = area(D)$$

Some simple examples:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\vec F = (0,x) \\
\vec F = (-y,0) \\
\vec F = \left(-\frac{y}{2}, \frac{x}{2}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: this approach is used in a real-world tool to calculate areas.

~~Example: Application of Green's Theorem

Compute the area of the ellipse:

$$\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$$

In this case, we are using the line integral to get the area, so we can select our $\vec F$, as long as it satisfies the above requirements. However, let's find the parameterization first.

The parameterization of an ellipse is:

$$
\vec x(t) = (a\cos t, b\sin t), t\in [0,2\pi]
$$

In this case, it is easiest to use the third formula for $\vec F$ above:

$$\vec F = \left(-\frac{y}{2}, \frac{x}{2}\right)$$

And we can compute the line integral:

$$\int_0^2\pi \left(\frac{ab}{2}\sin^2t + \frac{ab}{2}\cos^2 t\right)dt$$
$$\int_0^2\pi \frac{ab}{2}dt$$
$$=\pi ab$$

~~

#### Conservative Field

Remember from calculus 3 that a conservative field is one who's line integral is $0$ over a closed loop.

Using Green's Theorem, we can show that a field is conservative if $\iint\limits_D \left({\partial F_2 \over \partial x} - {\partial F_1 \over \partial y}\right)dA = 0$, then it is conservative. This means that if:

$${\partial F_2 \over \partial x} = {\partial F_1 \over \partial y}$$

Then the field is conservative. This makes sense, as a conservative field is one which is the gradient of another function $\Phi$, meaning:

$$\vec F = \left({\partial \Phi \over \partial x} - {\partial \Phi \over \partial y}\right) = (\Phi_x, \Phi_y)$$

So, if this is the case, the equation above would become:

$${\partial F_2 \over \partial x} = {\partial F_1 \over \partial y}$$
$${\partial \Phi_y \over \partial x} = {\partial \Phi_x \over \partial y}$$
$$\Phi_{yx} = \Phi_{xy}$$

Which is always true, due to the properties of partial derivatives.

This is formalized in another theorem:

> Theorem:  
> $\vec F$ is conservative if and only if there is a continuously differentiable scalar field $f$ where:  
> $$\vec F = \nabla f$$
