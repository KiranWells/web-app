# Orthogonality for Subspaces

## Definition

> Definition:  
> If $X$ and $Y$ are subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$, then they are orthogonal if every vector in them is perpendicular to the vectors in the other:
> $$\{x \perp y | x \in X, y \in Y\}$$

Note: for any subspace, there can be many perpendicular subspaces. To define a set of all the perpendicular vectors to $X$, we need the **orthogonal complement**:

> Definition: Orthogonal Complement  
> Given a subspace $X$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$, the orth. complement of $X$ ($X^{\perp}$) is:
> $$X^{\perp} = \{v \in R^n : v \perp x\ for\ any\ x \in X\}$$

Note: If $Y = X^{\perp}$, $X = Y{\perp}$. This is why we call these orthogonal complements.

~~Example 1

Find $X^{\perp}$ where $X = span\{e_1\}$.

$$X = \{(a, 0,0)^T: a \in \mathbb{R}\}$$

$$X^{\perp} = \{(v_1, v_2, v_3)^T: (v_1, v_2, v_3)(a,0,0)^T = 0\}$$

$$v_1a + v_2 0 + v_3 0 = 0$$

$$X^{\perp} = \{(0, v_2, v_3)\}$$

~~

## Properties

1. If $X\perp Y$, then $X\cap Y = {\bar 0}$

~~Proof 1

$$v \in X\cap Y$$
$$v \in X, v\in Y$$

This means that $v$ must be orthogonal to itself, so:

$$v^Tv = 0$$
$$||v||^2 = 0$$
$$||v|| = 0$$
$$v = \bar 0$$

This is useful to determine if subspaces are orthogonal.

~~

2. If $X$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$, $X^{\perp}$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$

~~Proof 2

We need to check if $X^{\perp}$ is closed under addition and scalar multiplication:

$$v_1, v_2 \in X$$

$$v_1^Tx = 0$$
$$v_2^Tx = 0$$

For all $x$ in $X$.

Addition:
$$(v_1 + v_2)^Tx = (v_1^T + v_2^T)x = v_1^Tx + v_2^Tx = 0$$

Scalar multiplication:
$$(\alpha v_1)^Tx = \alpha v_1^Tx = \alpha(v_1^T x) = 0$$

This is not very useful.

~~

3. If $X, Y$ are subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$, $\{x_1...x_m\}$ is a basis of $X$, and $\{y_1...x_p\}$ is a basis of $Y$, then $X\perp Y$ if and only if every element of the bases are perpendicular.

~~Example for property 3

It is easy to show that the $xz$-plane and the $xy$-plane are not orthogonal, because they share a vector in their bases:

$$xz = span\{e_1,e_3\}$$
$$xy = span\{e_1,e_2\}$$

$$e_1^Te_1 = 1 \ne 0$$

This shows that this property is very useful.

~~

4. If $S$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$, then $\dim(S) + \dim(S^{\perp}) = n$. In other words, combining a basis of $S$ with a basis of $S^{\perp}$ will give us a basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$.

For the fifth property, we need another definition:

> Definition: Direct Sum  
> If $U$ and $V$ are subspaces of $W$, $W$ is a **direct sum** of $U$ and $V$ if every $w \in W$ can be decomposed uniquely into two components $u \in U$ and $v \in V$:
> $$W = U \oplus V$$
> if
> $$w = u + v$$

This is similar to how vectors can be broken into separate component parts.

5. $\mathbb{R}^n = S \oplus S^{\perp}$

## Row, Column, and Null Spaces

Remember that the column space of a matrix $A$ is the span of its column vectors. In addition, the column space of $A$ is the range of $L = Ax$ ($range(L) = \{Ax: x \in \mathbb{R}^n\}$).

Note: even though columns starts with c, we call the column space of $A$ $R(A)$, standing for the range of the associated transformation. Similarly, $R(A^T)$ is the row space of $A$.

~~Motivating Question

What is $R(A)^{\perp}$?

$$R(A)^{\perp} = \{v: v\perp b, b \in R(A)\}$$

So, try to find $v$:

$$v^Tb = 0$$
$$v^T(Ax) = 0$$
$$(Ax)^Tv = 0$$
$$x^T(A^Tv) = 0$$

And since $x$ may not be $0$, $A^Tv$ must be $0$:

$$A^Tv = 0 \to v \in N(A^T)$$

~~

So, $R(A)^{\perp} = N(A^T)$ (and $R(A^T)^{\perp} = N(A)$)

~~Example 1

$$
A = 
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 3 \\
2 & 6 \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$

First, let's find the column space, then the null space of the transpose:

$$
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 3 \\
0 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$

Since the first column is the only lead variable, the column space is:

$$R(A) = span\{(1,2)^T\}$$

$$
A^T = 
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 6 \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$
$$
\left[
\begin{array}{cc|c}
1 & 2 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$

And the solution to this will be:

$$x = (-2a, a)^T = span\{(-2, 1)^T\}$$

And we can show that $R(A) \perp N(A^T)$:

$$(1,2)(-2, 1)^T = 0$$

~~

~~Example 2

Given a subspace $S$ of $\mathbb{R}^3$:

$$
S = span\left\{
  \left(\begin{array}{c}1 \\ 1\\ 2\end{array}\right),
  \left(\begin{array}{c}1 \\ 2\\ 3\end{array}\right)
  \right\}
$$

Find $S^{\perp}$.

$$
S = col\ space(A) = 
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 1 \\
1 & 2 \\
2 & 3 \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$

So, $S^{\perp} = N(A^T)$:

$$
A^T = 
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 1 & 2 \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$

$$
N(A) = 
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 1 & 2 & 0 \\
1 & 2 & 3 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$
$$
N(A) = 
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 1 & 2 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$

With two lead variables and one free, solving gives:

$$
S^{\perp} = span\left\{
  \left(\begin{array}{c}-1 \\ -1\\ 1\end{array}\right)
  \right\}
$$

To double check, we can see if these subspaces are perpendicular.
