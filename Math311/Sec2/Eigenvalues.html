# Eigenvalues

## Introduction

Note: 3Blue1Brown has a [very good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g) on the intuition for this topic, I highly recommend it.

Since each matrix represents a linear transformation, we can visualize the matrix by the effect that it has on a vector. For example, the matrix:

$$
\left[
  \begin{array}{cc}
  3 & 0 \\
  0 & 3
  \end{array}
\right]
$$

simply scales the vector by 3. 

For every matrix, there are vectors, which we call **eigenvectors**, which are *only* scaled by the matrix. The factor by which they are scaled is called the **eigenvalue**:

$$L(x^*) = Ax^* = \lambda x^*$$

Where $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue, and $x^*$ is the eigenvector.

These effects, although they sound abstract, have applications in several different fields, such as:

- Google page rank algorithm
  - uses particular eigenvectors
- Behavior of complex systems (differential equations)
  - uses the signs of eigenvalues
- Data science - patterns, clusters, networks
  - uses the largest eigenvalues
- Image compression
  - uses the smallest eigenvalues

> Definition: Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors  
> Given and $n \times n$ matrix A, the **eigenvalue** $\lambda$ is defined if there is a non-zero vector $x$ where:  
> $$Ax = \lambda x$$  
> Where $x$ is called an **eigenvector**.

## Finding Eigenvalues

To make it simpler to find these vectors, we will rearrange the definition (this may look familiar if you have worked with eigenvalues/vectors before):

$$Ax = \lambda x$$
$$Ax - \lambda x = \bar 0$$
$$(A - \lambda I)x = \bar 0$$

This is now an equation for the null space of the matrix $(A - \lambda I)$, so $x \in N(A - \lambda I)$. We can also determine if there is a solution to this equation by using the properties of singular matrices:

If $M$ is non-singular, $Mx = \bar 0$ has one solution $x = \bar 0$.  
If $M$ is singular, $Mx = \bar 0$ has $\infty$ solutions.

To determine if the matrix is singular, we need the determinant of it, $det(A - \lambda I)$. This will result in a characteristic polynomial $p(\lambda)$, which can be solved to find where it is 0, meaning there is a solution to the definition and that $\lambda$ is and eigenvalue.

$$det(A - \lambda I) = 0$$

Which is called the characteristic equation of $A$. The eigenvectors, as mentioned before, can be found with:

$$N(A - \lambda I)$$

and is called the **eigenspace** of $\lambda$.

~~Example 1

$$
A = 
\left[
  \begin{array}{cc}
  3 & 2 \\
  3 & -2
  \end{array}
\right]
$$

The $\lambda$ equation will give:

$$
A - \lambda I = 
\left[
  \begin{array}{cc}
  3 & 2 \\
  3 & -2
  \end{array}
\right] -
\left[
  \begin{array}{cc}
  \lambda & 0 \\
  0 & \lambda
  \end{array}
\right] =
\left[
  \begin{array}{cc}
  3 - \lambda & 2 \\
  3 & -2 - \lambda
  \end{array}
\right]
$$

The determinant gives:

$$det(A - \lambda I) = 0$$
$$(3 - \lambda)(-2 - \lambda) - 32 = 0$$
$$\lambda^2 - \lambda - 12 = 0$$

$$\lambda = -3, 4$$

Finding the eigenvectors for $\lambda = -3$, we solve:

$$(A - \lambda I)x = 0$$

So we get:

$$
\left[
  \begin{array}{cc|c}
  3 - \lambda & 2 & 0 \\
  3 & -2 - \lambda & 0
  \end{array}
\right] =
\left[
  \begin{array}{cc|c}
  6 & 2 & 0 \\
  3 & 1 & 0
  \end{array}
\right]
$$

$$
\left[
  \begin{array}{cc|c}
  3 & 1 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0
  \end{array}
\right]
$$

Here you can see there is one lead variable and one free, which shows this is a valid eigenvector as there is at least one free variable.

Solving gives:

$$
\begin{cases}
x_1 = -\frac{1}{3}\alpha \\ 
x_2 = \alpha
\end{cases}
$$

$$
x = span\left\{\left(\begin{array}{c}-\frac{1}{3} \\ 1\end{array}\right)\right\}
$$

~~

### Complex numbers

The characteristic equation may have complex roots, resulting in complex eigenvalues and eigenvectors. These are valid solutions, even though they are not "real". Solving uses the same process, but requires some familiarity with imaginary numbers.

~~and example with complex numbers

$$
A = 
\left[
  \begin{array}{cc}
  1 & 2 \\
  -2 & 1
  \end{array}
\right]
$$

The characteristic equation will give:

$$ 
\left|
  \begin{array}{cc}
  1-\lambda & 2 \\
  -2 & 1\lambda
  \end{array}
\right|
$$

$$(1 - \lambda)^2 + 4 = 0$$
$$(1 - \lambda)^2 =- 4$$

$$\lambda = 1 \pm 2i$$

Note that in these cases, the solution will always be pairs, of the form $a + bi$ and $a - bi$.

Solving for the eigenvectors starts with the equation:

$$
\left[
  \begin{array}{cc}
  -2i & 2 \\
  -2 & -2i
  \end{array}
\right]x = 
\left[
  \begin{array}{c}
  0 & 0
  \end{array}
\right]
$$

$$
\left[
  \begin{array}{cc|c}
  -2i & 2 & 0\\
  -2 & -2i & 0
  \end{array}
\right]
$$

To simplify this, multiply the first row by $i$, and the bottom by $-1$:

$$
\left[
  \begin{array}{cc|c}
  2 & 2i & 0\\
  2 & 2i & 0
  \end{array}
\right]
$$

Here we can solve for:

$$
\begin{cases}
x_2 = \alpha\\
2x_1 + 2ix_2 = 0
\end{cases}
$$
$$
\begin{cases}
x_2 = \alpha\\
x_1 = -i\alpha
\end{cases}
$$

Giving the eigenvector:

$$
x = 
span\left\{\left(\begin{array}{c}-i \\ 1\end{array}\right)\right\}
$$

~~

## Properties

Given an $n\times n$ matrix $A$:

1. $A$ has exactly $n$ eigenvalues, including all of the complex or repeated roots (multiplicity).  
    (this means that you can have a solution with the same eigenvalues, but they will be from repeated roots, ex: $(1 - \lambda)^2 = 0$)
2. The sum of the eigenvalues is the same as the sum of the diagonal entries of $A$:
$$\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + ... + \lambda_n = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n$$
3. The product of the eigenvalues is the same as the determinant of the matrix $A$:
$$\lambda_1 * \lambda_2 * ... * \lambda_n = det(A)$$
4. Given an eigenvector $x$ of an eigenvalue $\lambda$:
$$A^kx = \lambda^kx$$
~~Proof 4
$$Ax = \lambda x$$
$$A^2x = \lambda (Ax) = \lambda (\lambda x)$$
$$A^2x = \lambda^2 x$$
~~

~~an example similar to the Google page rank algorithm

This is a very simplistic example which resembles the algorithm, the actual algorithm is much more complex.

To start, imagine we searched for a keyword and found 3 websites containing it. Website 1 has references to 2 and 3, website 2 has a link to 1 and 3, and website 3 has a link to 1.

$$
\begin{cases}
1 \to 2, 3 \\
2 \to 1, 3 \\
3 \to 1
\end{cases}
$$

We want to assign importance to the 3 websites and use it to rank them. We will call their importance:

$$
x = 
\left(
  x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3
\right)
$$

Websites which reference others pass a portion of their importance to other websites:

1. passes 50% of its importance to 2 and 3
2. passes 50% of its importance to 1 and 3
3. passes 100% of its importance to 1

So we have the system:

$$
\begin{cases}
x_1 = .5x_2 + x_3 \\
x_2 = .5x_1 \\
x_3 = .5x_1 + .5x_2
\end{cases}
$$

Writing this as a matrix gives:

$$
\left[
  \begin{array}{ccc}
  0 & .5 & 1\\
  .5 & 0 & 0\\
  .5 & .5 & 0
  \end{array}
\right]
\left[
  \begin{array}{c}
 x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3
  \end{array}
\right] = 
\left[
  \begin{array}{c}
 x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3
  \end{array}
\right]
$$

Which is the same as:

$$Ax = 1x$$

So we are trying to find the eigenvector $x$ which corresponds to the eigenvalue $1$. It can be proved that this is always true for this type of problem, but that is an exercise for the reader, I guess.

So, we need to solve for (using the eigenvalue formula):

$$
\left|
  \begin{array}{ccc}
  -\lambda & .5 & 1\\
  .5 & -\lambda & 0\\
  .5 & .5 & -\lambda
  \end{array}
\right|
$$

Which (after a lot of expansion), will be:

$$
-\lambda^3 + \frac{3}{4}\lambda + \frac{1}{4} = 0
$$

Which, guessing that $1$ will be one of the valid values, we get:

$$\lambda = -.5, -.5, 1$$

Now that we know $1$ is an eigenvalue, we can solve for the eigenvectors:

$$
\left[
  \begin{array}{ccc|c}
  -1 & .5 & 1 & 0\\
  .5 & -1 & 0 & 0\\
  .5 & .5 & -1 & 0
  \end{array}
\right]
$$

Giving:

$$
x = 
span\left\{\left(\begin{array}{c}\frac{4}{3} \\ \frac{2}{3} \\ 1\end{array}\right)\right\}
$$

Which shows that website 1 is the most important, followed by 3 and then 2. By looking at the diagram, we can see this makes sense, given that references from other websites to yourself are important.
