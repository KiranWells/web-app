# Orthogonality for Vectors

## Introduction

In a 2D space, such as a graph, two lines can be said to be "perpendicular" when they are at $90°$ angle. This is used to define distance, particularly between a line and a point.

In larger degrees of space, or in more generalized vector spaces, we use **orthogonality** to serve a similar purpose; it is the analog of being perpendicular in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\mathbb{R}^3$.

## Definition for vectors

First, let us define an operation called **scalar product**, which will let us define what it means to be orthogonal in $\mathbb{R}^n$. If the scalar product (sometimes called dot product in calculus) is 0, two vectors are orthogonal.

### Scalar Product

> Definition: Scalar Product  
> Given two vectors $x = \left(\begin{array}{c}x_1 \\ x_2 \end{array}\right)$, $y = \left(\begin{array}{c}y_1 \\ y_2 \end{array}\right)$, the scalar product of $x$ and $y$ is:  
> $$x \cdot y = x^Ty = x_1y_1 + x_2y_2$$

For the scalar product, it is important to note that it is commutative, meaning you ca swap the order of the vectors:

$$x^Ty = y^Tx$$

> Definition: Orthogonal  
> Two vectors are orthagonal ($x \perp y$) if $x^Ty = 0$.

Now that we have these definitions, it will be useful to define length and distance.

> Definition: Euclidean Length  
> Let $x = \left(\begin{array}{c}x_1 \\ x_2 \end{array}\right)$, the Euclidean length of $x$ is:  
> $$||x|| = \sqrt{x^Tx} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2}$$

> Definition: Distance  
> Given $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^2$, the distance between $x$ and $y$ is:  
> $$||x - y|| = \sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2}$$

One more important thing to note is a property of the scalar product (given $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^2$):

$$x^Ty = ||x|| * ||y|| * cos(\theta)$$

Where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors.

## Uses

The first use is to define a property analagous to perpendicularity. In $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$, the two terms are equavalent, but orthagonality extends to all dimensions of vector. This has some interesting properties:

1. If $x$ and $y$ are orthagonal, then we have:

$$x^Ty = 0$$
$$||x|| ||y||\cos(\theta) = 0$$
$$cos(\theta) = 0$$
$$\theta = 90° = \pi/2$$

2. If $x,y$ are orthagonal:

$$||x+y||^2 = ||x||^2 + ||y||^2$$

~~Proof of 2

$$||x+y||^2 = (x^T + y^T)(x + y)$$
$$x^Tx + x^Ty + y^Tx + y^Ty$$
$$||x||^2 + 0 + 0 + ||y||^2$$
$$||x||^2 + ||y||^2$$

~~

Note that this proof is valid for all dimensions.

3. Cauchy-Schwartz inequality

$$|x^Ty| = ||x|| ||y|| \cos(\theta)$$
$$|x^Ty| <= ||x|| ||y||$$

## Applications

Because we have the $\cos(\theta)$ in the forumla for scalar product, we can get the angle between the two vectors as:

$$\cos(\theta) = {x^Ty \over ||x|| ||y||}$$

~~Example 1

Find the angle between $x = (3, 4)^T$ and $y = (-1, 7)^T$

$$\cos(\theta) = {x^Ty \over ||x|| ||y||}$$
$$\cos(\theta) = {3(-1) + 4(7) \over \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 7^2}}$$
$$\cos(\theta) = {25 \over \sqrt{25} \sqrt{50}}$$
$$\cos(\theta) = \sqrt{1 \over 2}$$
$$\theta = \arccos\left(\sqrt{1 \over 2}\right) = \cos^{-1}\left(\sqrt{{1 \over 2}}\right) = 45° $$

~~

The other property of the scalar product is that it represents a projection of one vector onto the other. [See this video by 3Blue1Brown for a better intuition about scalar product](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/dot-products).

This means that we can break any vector into two components; one which is in the direction of the other vector (the projection) and one which is perpendicular. This is especially useful when finding distances or coordinates of a vector, for example.

The formula for the scalar projection is:

$$\alpha = {x^Ty \over ||y||}$$

~~Derivation

$$\alpha = ||x||\cos(\theta)$$
$$\alpha = ||x||{x^Ty \over ||x|| ||y||}$$
$$\alpha = {x^Ty \over ||y||}$$

~~

This projection will be in the direction of the vector $y$, which is denoted by the **unit vector**, defined as follows:

$$\hat i_y = {y \over ||y||}$$

So, the vector projection $p$ for a vector $x$ is:

$$p = {x^Ty \over ||y||}{y \over ||y||}$$
$$p = {x^Ty \over ||y||^2}y$$

~~Example 2

Find the distance between a point and a line.

$$x = (1, 2)^T$$
$$y = \frac{3}{4}x$$

We can define the direction of the line as:

$$y = (4, 3)^T$$

So, we find the vector projection of $x$ on $y$, then subtract that from the original vector to find the perpendicular part between $x$ and $y$:

$$p = {x^Ty \over ||y||^2}y$$
$$p = {1(4) + 2(3) \over 4^2 + 3^2}(4, 3)^T$$
$$p = {10 \over 25}(4, 3)^T$$
$$p = \left(\frac{8}{5}, \frac{6}{5}\right)^T$$

Now we can find the distance as the length of the perpendicular part:

$$x = p + z$$
$$z = x - p = (1, 2)^T - \left(\frac{8}{5}, \frac{6}{5}\right)^T = \left(\frac{-3}{5}, \frac{4}{5}\right)^T$$

Distance is the length of $z$:

$$||z|| = \sqrt{\frac{3}{5}^2 + \frac{4}{5}^2} = 1$$

~~

~~Example 3

Find the distance between: $(1,4)$ and $y = x + 1$.

Since the line is not at the origin, we shift everything down by $1$ to make it fit our process in the previous example.

So we now have: $(1,3)$ and $y = x$, and we can use $(1,1)$ for $y$

~~

The final application is finding the distance between a point and a plane in 3D space. This seems more complex at first, because there is not a single line defining it, but a whole surface. Instead, we will use **normal vectors** to represent the direction of the plane.

> Definition: Normal vector  
> The normal $N$ is a vector that is orthagonal to a plane.

~~Example 4

Write the equation of a plane with normal vector $N = (1, 2, -1)^T$ and (1) passing through the origin, (2) the same plane if it passed through $(2,3,5)$, and (3) the distance between the first plane and the point $(3,1,1)$.

1. Any vector on the plane will be orthagonal with the normal and pass through the origin, so we have:

$$
\left(\begin{array}{c}x \\ y \\ z\end{array}\right)^T
\left(\begin{array}{c}1 \\ 2 \\ -1\end{array}\right)= 0
$$

$$x + 2y - z = 0$$

2. Any vector on the plane will be orthagonal with the normal and pass through $(2,3,5)$, so we have:

$$
\left(\begin{array}{c}x - 2 \\ y - 3 \\ z - 5\end{array}\right)^T
\left(\begin{array}{c}1 \\ 2 \\ -1\end{array}\right)= 0
$$

$$(x-2) + 3(y-3) - (z-5)=0$$
$$x + 3y - z = 3$$

3. Using the equation from (1), we have:

$$P = (3,1,1)$$
$$x + 2y - z = 0$$

Here, the distance is the part of the vector orthogonal to the plane, or parallel (projected onto) to normal.

So, we simply take the length of the vector projected onto $N$:

$$|\alpha| = \left|{x^Ty \over ||y||}\right|$$
$$|\alpha| = \left|{3(1)+1(2)+1(-1) \over \sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + (-1)^2}}\right|$$
$$|\alpha| = \left|\frac{4}{\sqrt{6}}\right|$$

To find the distance with the plane in (2), we would have to shift the plane and point so that the plane passes through the origin.
