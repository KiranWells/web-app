# Linear Transformations Using Matrices

Remember that we mentioned earlier that ant linear transformation can be represented as a matrix multiplication.

$$L(x) = Ax$$

Note: you can extract the columns of a matrix by multiplying by a vector of all zeros and one 1.

~~Example

Given:

$$
A = 
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
  1 & 2 & 3 \\
  1 & 0 & 1 \\
  2 & 1 & 0
\end{array}
\right]
$$

$$
Ae_1 = 
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
  1 & 2 & 3 \\
  1 & 0 & 1 \\
  2 & 1 & 0
\end{array}
\right]
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
  1 \\ 0 \\ 0 
\end{array}
\right] =
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
  1 \\ 2 \\ 3 
\end{array}
\right]
$$

## Finding the matrix

> Theorem  
> Let $L: \mathbb{R}^n to \mathbb{R}^m$ be a linear transformation. There is a matrix $A$ ($m \times n$) such that $L(x) = Ax$.

To find $A$, the $i^{th}$ column of $A$ is given by $a_i = L(e_i)$. $A$ is called the matrix representing $L$.

~~Example 1

$$
L(x) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
  x_1 + x_2 \\ x_1 + x_3
\end{array}
\right)
$$

Find a matrix representing $L$.

Using the method above, we find each column:

1. $$
a_1 = L(e_1) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
  1 + 0 \\ 1 + 0
\end{array}
\right) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
  1 \\ 1
\end{array}
\right)
$$
2. $$
a_2 = L(e_2) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
  0 + 1 \\ 0 + 0
\end{array}
\right) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
  1 \\ 0
\end{array}
\right)
$$
1. $$
a_3 = L(e_3) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
  0 + 0 \\ 0 + 1
\end{array}
\right) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
  0 \\ 1
\end{array}
\right)
$$ <!-- -->

So we have:

$$
A = 
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
  1 & 1 & 0 \\
  1 & 0 & 1 
\end{array}
\right]
$$

~~

Another way to find $A$ if we know $L(x)$ explicitly is to just write the matrix a as the coefficient matrix that gives the resulting vector of $L$:

~~Example 2

$$
L(x) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
  x_1 + x_2 \\ x_1 + x_3
\end{array}
\right) =
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
  x_1 * 1 + x_2 * 1 + x_3 * 0 \\ 
  x_1 * 1 + x_2 * 0 + x_3 * 1
\end{array}
\right)
$$

$$
A = 
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
  1 & 1 & 0 \\
  1 & 0 & 1 
\end{array}
\right]
$$

$$
L = Ax = 
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
  1 & 1 & 0 \\
  1 & 0 & 1 
\end{array}
\right]
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
  x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 
\end{array}
\right]
$$

> Corollary  
> Given a linear transformation $L$, and the matrix $A$ representing $L$ where $L = Ax$, the kernel, range, and image of $L$ can be found as:
> $$ker(L) = \{x \in V | L(x) = 0\}$$
> $$ker(L) = \{x \in V | Ax = 0\} = N(A)$$
> $$L(x) = \{L(x) | x \in V\} = \{Ax | x \in V\} = col\ space(A)$$
> Given a subspace $S$ with basis $[v_1, v_2,...v_n]$, the image is:
> $$L(S) = \{L(x) | x \in S\} = span\{L(v_1), L(v_2),...L(v_n)\}$$

## General matrix representation

Given some transformation which is not explicitly or simply defined, we can still find a matrix. For example, take the transformation:

$$L(\alpha_1v_1 + \alpha_2 v_2 + \alpha_3 v_3) = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)v_1 + (3\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)v_2$$

Where $v_1, v_2, v_3$ are given as some basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$.

Remember that the coordinates relative to a basis of some vector space (denoted as $[v]_E$ for a vector space $E$) are the coefficients multiplied by its basis vectors to get that vector.

> Theorem  
> Given $L: V \to W$ is a linear transformation, $E = [v_1 ... v_n]$$ is a basis of $V$, and $F = [w_1 ... w_n]$ is a basis of $W$, there is a matrix $A_{EF}$ ($m \times n$) representing $L$ relative to $E$ and $F$.  
> $$[L(v)]_F = A_{EF}[v]_E$$

Note that $A_{EF}$ above is not the same $A$ in $L(x) = Ax$. 

While this sounds confusing, this essentially means that we can find the matrix which represents the transformation of a coordinate in the starting basis to a coordinate of $L(x)$ in another basis. Some transformations are easier to represent in this way than a simple $L(x) = Ax$.

This adds another layer of calculation, as you need to get the coordinates of the vector, transform them with $A_{EF}$, and then use those coordinates in the new space to get the resulting vector.

Note: if $V=W$, and $E=F$, then we say $A$ is a matrix representing $L$ relative to $E$: $A_E$. This may appear in the homework.

~~Example similar to homework

Given:

$$
E = \left\{
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
  1 \\ 0
\end{array}
\right),
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
  1 \\ 2
\end{array}
\right)
\right\}
$$
as a basis of $\mathbb{R}^2$, and 
$$
L(a_1v_1 + a_2 v_2) = (a_1 + a_2)v_1 + (3a_1 - a_2)v_2
$$

1. Find $A_E$ representing $L$ relative to $E$
2. Find $L(x)$ if $x = \left(\begin{array}{c}  4 \\ 1\end{array}\right)$

First, to find $A_{EF}$, the $i^{th}$ column of $A_{EF}$ is:

$$a_i = [L(v_i)]_F$$

So,

$$a_1 = [L(v_1)]_E \to L(1v_1 + 0v_2) = (1 + 0)v_1 + (3*1-0)v_2 = 1v_1 + 3v_2$$
$$[L(v_1)]_E = [1, 3]$$
$$a_2 = [L(v_2)]_E \to L(0v_1 + 1v_2) = (0 + 1)v_1 + (3*1-1)v_2 = 1v_1 + -1v_2$$
$$[L(v_1)]_E = [1, -1]$$

So $A_{E}$ is:

$$
A_E = 
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
  1 &  1 \\
  3 & -1 
\end{array}
\right]
$$

Now that we have this matrix, we can find the coordinates of the input and transform them into the coordinates of the output.

The coordinates in the new basis are found, using the formula from last section:

$$[x]_E = E^{-1}x$$

$$
E = 
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
  1 & 1 \\
  0 & 2 
\end{array}
\right]
$$

Which are:

$$[x]_E = \left(\begin{array}{c} \frac{7}{2} \\ \frac{1}{2} \end{array}\right)$$

$$[L(x)]_E = A_E[x]_E$$
$$
[L(x)]_E = 
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
  1 &  1 \\
  3 & -1 
\end{array}
\right]
\left[\begin{array}{c} \frac{7}{2} \\ \frac{1}{2} \end{array}\right]
=
\left[\begin{array}{c} 4 \\ 10 \end{array}\right]
$$

And we can find the new vector as:

$$
4 v_1 + 10v_2 = 
\left[\begin{array}{c} 14 \\ 20 \end{array}\right]
$$
