# Components of Acceleration

## Physics application

A vector equation has properties of the parameterization, such as velocity.

Velocity: $\vec v(t) = \vec r'(t)$  
Speed: $\nu(t) = |\vec v(t)|$  
Acceleration: $\vec a(t) = \vec v'(t) = \vec r''(t)$

### Application:

The path of a projectile:

$$Acceleration:$$
$$\vec a(t) = \vec g$$
$$\vec v(t) = \int a(t) = \vec gt + v_0$$
$$\vec r(t) = \int v(t) = \frac{1}{2}\vec gt^2 + v_0t + p_0$$
$$\vec g = -9.8\hat j$$

## Components of Acceleration

Acceleration is on the inside of the curve (in the concave area)

The acceleration had two components:
One along the velocity, and one perpendicular to it.

The one along the velocity is the tangential component, and the perpendicular one is the normal component.
Tangential determines the speed, normal determines the "curviness"

$$\vec T(t) = {\vec r'(t)\over |r'(t)|} = {\vec v(t)\over |\vec v(t)|} = {\vec v(t)\over \nu(t)}$$
$$\vec v(t) = \nu(t) * T(t)$$
$$\vec a (t) = \vec v'(t) = \nu'(t) * T + \nu(t) * T'(t)$$

Note: $T(t)$ is orthogonal to $T'(t)$.
This is because $|T(t)|$ is constant (see Example 12.4.2, p. 816)

Let N be the unit vector parallel to T'(t):
$$\vec N(t) = {T'(t)\over |T'(t)|}$$
$$T'(t) = \vec N * |T'(t)|$$
Since
$$\nu(t) = |v(t)|$$
$$K = {|T'|\over|r'|} = {|T'|\over \nu}$$
$$|T'| = \kappa * \nu$$
$$T' = |T'| * \vec N = \kappa*\nu*\vec N$$

$$a(t) = \nu'T + \kappa*\nu^2N$$
