As a quick note before we get into the rest: this chapter focuses on differentiating multivariable functions and using those derivatives. Multivariable functions are defined as a function that goes from a pair or set of real numbers to a single real number.

$$y = f(x)$$
Becomes
$$z = f(x,y)$$
Or even
$$s = f(x,y,z)$$

### [Partial Derivatives](14/partial-derivatives.html)

The partial derivative of a multivariable function depends on the direction it is taken in. The most common are the derivatives in the directions of x and y:

$$f_x = \frac{d}{dx} f(x,y)$$
$$f_y = \frac{d}{dy} f(x,y)$$

This also works with higher numbers of variables:

$$f_z = \frac{d}{dz} f(x,y,z)$$

These derivatives can be found by simply differentiating with respect to one of the variables and treating the other as a constant

**Question**  
Find partial derivatives for the following functions:

$$f(x,y) = 2x + 6y$$
[$$f(x,y) = 2xy + 4x^2 - 5y^2x$$](https://llumen.neocities.org/projects/ray-grapher.html?eq=2xy%2B4x%5E2-5y%5E2x%3Dz&zoom=5&m=[204,-30])
[$$f(x,y) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$](https://llumen.neocities.org/projects/ray-grapher.html?eq=z%3Dsqrt(x%5E2%2By%5E2)&zoom=5&m=[264,0])
$$f(x,y) = y\ln{x}$$

**Solution**  

$$f_x = 2, f_y = 6$$
$$f_x = 2y + 8x - 5y^2$$
$$f_y = 2x - 10xy$$
$$f_x = {x\over \sqrt(x^2 + y^2)}$$
$$f_y = {y\over \sqrt(x^2 + y^2)}$$
$$f_x = \frac{y}{x}$$
$$f_y = \ln{x}$$

</details> 

Second derivatives require differentiating each part into more parts:

$$f_{xx} = \frac{d}{dx} f_x$$
$$f_{xy} = \frac{d}{dy} f_x$$
$$f_{yx} = \frac{d}{dx} f_y$$
$$f_{yy} = \frac{d}{dy} f_y$$

$$z = f(x,y) = x^2y + e^{xy}$$
$${df\over dx} = f_x = 2xy + ye^{xy}$$
$$f_{xx} = 2y + y^2e^{xy}$$

#### [Chain Rule One](14/tangent_planes.html)

Given a two-variable function $z = f(x,y)$, use the two portions as functions themselves. $x = g(t)$, $y = h(t)$
$$z(t) = f(g(t),h(t))$$
$${dz\over dt} = {\delta f\over \delta x}{dx\over dt} + {\delta f\over \delta y}{dy\over dt}$$

**Question**
Let $z = x^2y + 3xy^4$, where $x = \sin(2t)$, $y = \cos(t)$.
Find $dz\over dt$ at $t=0$

**Solution**
$${dz\over dt} = {\delta f\over \delta x}{dx\over dt} + {\delta f\over \delta y}{dy\over dt}$$
$${dz\over dt} = {\delta f\over \delta x}(2\cos(2t)) + {\delta f\over \delta y}(-\sin(t))$$
$${dz\over dt} = {\delta f\over \delta x}(2) + {\delta f\over \delta y}(0)$$
$${dz\over dt} = (2yx + 3y^4)(2)$$
$${dz\over dt} = (2y(t)x(t) + 3(y(t))^4)(2)$$
$${dz\over dt} = (2y(0)x(0) + 3(y(0))^4)(2)$$
$${dz\over dt} = (2\cos(0)\sin(0) + 3(\cos(0))^4)(2)$$
$${dz\over dt} = (3)(2) = 6$$

#### [Chain Rule Two](14/more_differentiation.html)

Given a two-variable function $z = f(x,y)$, use the two portions as multivariable functions themselves. $x = g(s, t)$, $y = h(s, t)$
$${\delta z\over \delta s} = {\delta z\over \delta x} * {\delta x\over \delta s} + {\delta z\over \delta y} * {\delta y\over \delta s}$$
$${\delta z\over \delta t} = {\delta z\over \delta x} * {\delta x\over \delta t} + {\delta z\over \delta y} * {\delta y\over \delta t}$$

**Question**

$z = e^x\sin(y)$, where $x = st^2$, $y = s^2t$. Find $\delta z\over \delta s$

**Solution**

$${\delta z\over \delta s} = {\delta z\over \delta x} * {\delta x\over \delta s} + {\delta z\over \delta y} * {\delta y\over \delta s}$$

$${\delta z\over \delta s} = e^x\sin(y) * t^2 + e^x\cos(y) * 2st$$

This is not desirable because it depends on 4 variables, so plug $st^2$ and $s^2t$ for $x$ and $y$

$${\delta z\over \delta s} = e^{st^2}\sin(s^2t) * t^2 + e^{st^2}\cos(s^2t) * 2st$$

#### [Directional Derivative](14/directional_derivatives.html)

The derivative can also be taken in a certain direction. So, we just add together the parts of the vector multiplied by the gradient. The formula for this is:

$$D_{\vec u}f(x,y) = f_x(x,y) * a + f_y(x,y) * b$$

Which means that the derivative in the direction of $\vec u = \langle a,b \rangle$ is equal to the partial derivatives multiplied by the components of $\vec u$

#### [Gradient Vector](14/directional_derivatives.html)

The gradient is the vector made of the two partial derivatives.

$$\nabla f = \langle f_x f_y \rangle$$

***This gradient vector defines the direction of the largest slope.***

### [Local Maximum and Minimum](14/max_and_min.html)

The local maximum and minimum can be found by finding critical points, then checking to see if they are max, min, saddle, or unknown

#### [Critical Points](14/max_and_min.html)

Critical points are all the places where $f'(x,y) = 0$.
Meaning:

$$f_x = f_y = 0$$

#### [Second Derivatives Test](14/max_and_min.html)

We can use the second derivative to see if they are maximums or minimums.


$$D(x,y) = \begin{vmatrix}f_{xx} f_{xy} \\ f_{yx} f_{yy}\end{vmatrix} = f_{xx}f_{yy} - f_{xy}f_{yx}$$

1. If $D(a,b) \gt 0$, we have $(a,b)$ is an extremum point.
   1. If $f_{xx}(a,b) \gt 0$, then $f(a,b)$ is a *local minimum* (concave up)
   2. If $f_{xx}(a,b) \lt 0$, then $f(a,b)$ is a *local maximum* (concave down)
   3. If $f_{xx}(a,b) = 0$, then the test is inconclusive
2. If $D(a,b) \lt 0$, then $f(a,b)$ is a *saddle point*
3. If $D(a,b) = 0$, then the results are inconclusive

Saddle points are like this:

**Question**  
Find the local max and min of the function [$f(x,y) = 3x^2y + y^3 - 3x^2 - 3y^2 + 1$](https://llumen.neocities.org/projects/ray-grapher.html?eq=z%3D3x%5E2y%2By%5E3-3x%5E2-3y%5E2%2B1&zoom=4&m=[442,-42])

**Solution**  
First, we find the critical points of the function, then use the second derivative test to check whether they are maximum or minimum.

- find where $f_x = f_y = 0$
- of those, find which ones $D \gt 0$ (if $D \lt 0$, it is a saddle point)
- of those, if $f_{xx}\lt 0$, it is a **maximum**, if $f_{xx} \lt 0$, it is a **minimum**

$$f_x = 6xy - 6x = 0$$
$$f_y = 3x^2 + 3y^2 - 6y = 0$$

The first equation gives that $x = 0$ or $y = 1$. By plugging those into the second equation:

- if $x = 0$, $y = 0,2$
- if $y = 1$, $x = 1,-1$

These are the critical points. $(0,0),(0,2),(1,1),(-1,1)$

So we test these points in the second derivative. (keep in mind that $f_{xy} = f_{yx}$)

$$D = f_{xx}f_{yy} - f_{xy}f_{yx}$$
$$D = (6y-6)^2 - (6x)^2$$

- $D(0,0) = 36 \gt 0$
- $D(0,2) = 36 \gt 0$
- $D(1,1) = -36 \lt 0$ - it is a saddle point
- $D(-1,1) = -36 \lt 0$ - it is a saddle point

So now we test in $f_{xx}$

- $f_{xx}(0,0) = -6 \lt 0$, so $(0,0)$ is a maximum
- $f_{xx}(0,2) = 6 \gt 0$, so $(0,2)$ is a minimum

### [Absolute Maximum and Minimum](14/absolute_max_min.html)

#### [Finding Max and Min on the Boundary of the Domain](14/absolute_max_min.html)

The absolute max and min can be found by checking all local max and min point in the closed domain $D$ along with all the critical points at the edge of the domain

<details>
  <summary>Click to show example 7 (14.7)</summary>

**Question**

Find the absolute max and min values of the function $(x,y) = x^2-2xy+2y$ On the rectangle $D = {(x,y)|0\le x\le 3, 0\le y\le 2}$

**Solution**

Since $D$ is closed, an absolute max and min are obtainable.

1. Find the critical points (x,y):
   $${\delta f\over\delta x}(x,y) = 2x-2y = 0 \to x = y$$
   $${\delta f\over\delta y}(x,y) = -2x+2 = 0\to x = 1$$
   Therefore, $(1,1)$ is the only critical point.
   $f(1,1) = 1^2 + 2*1*1  2*1 = 1$
2. Find the points at the boundary of $D$
   We split the edges into four parts:
   $D =$
   $${(0,y)|0\le y\le2}U$$
   $${(x,2)|0\le x\le3}U$$
   $${(3,y)|0\le y\le2}U$$
   $${(x,0)|0\le x\le3}$$
   $$0\le f(0,y)=2y\le 4$$
   $$0\le f(x,2)=x^2-4x+4 = (x-2)^2\le 4$$
   $$1 \le f(3,y) = 9-6y + 2y =9 - 4y\le 9$$
   $$0 \le f(x,0) = x^2 \le 9$$
   These points are the edges, and their max is 9 and min is 0.
   These are at the points $(3,0)$ and $(0,0)$. These are absolute (and local) maximum and minimum respectively

#### Lagrange Multipliers

Lagrange multipliers are a way to find the absolute max and min of a function $f(x,y)$ given a constraint $g(x,y) = k$

It states:

$$f(x,y) = \lambda g(x,y)$$

To solve these problems, we take the derivatives of each function and set them into these equations, and use the system of equations to solve for $x,y$

$$
\begin{cases}
  f_x = \lambda g_x \\
  f_y = \lambda g_y \\
  g(x,y) = k
\end{cases}
$$

**Question**  
Find max and min values for $f(x,y) = 8x^2 - 2y$ provided that $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ ($= g(x,y)$)

*Solution*  
First we find all the points on (x,y), with some scalar(constant) $\lambda$ that the following is true:

$$
\begin{cases}
  \nabla f = \lambda \nabla g \\
  g(x,y) = 1
\end{cases}
$$

Then, we choose among the pairs (x,y) that we found that are the largest/smallest

So, we compute the partial derivatives of each function, and set them equal with a scalar $\lambda$

$$ f_x = \lambda g_x $$
$$ f_y = \lambda g_y $$
$$ ... $$

So, for this we have:

$$
\begin{cases}
  16x = 2\lambda x \\
  -2 = 2\lambda y \\
  x^2 + y^2 = 1
\end{cases}
$$

**Step 1:** For the first equation, we have $x = 0$ or $\lambda = 8$. Using these in the third equation shows $y = ± 1$.
Therefore, $(0,-1)$ and $(0,1)$ are candidates

If $\lambda = 8$, then according to the second equation, $y = -1/8$. Using this in the third equation, we get $x = ±\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{64}}$

**Step 2:** Finding the candidate points for which $f(x,y)$ takes smallest and largest values.

This just means we evaluate the function at each point and take the largest and smallest values.

- $f(0,-1) = 8*0^2-2(-1)=2$
- $f(0,1) = 8*0^2-2(1)=-2$
- $f(±\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{64}},-1/8) = 8*(1-\frac{1}{64})-2(-1/8)=8-1/8 + 1/4 = 8 + 1/8$

**Answer:** The absolute max of $f(x,y)$ when $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ is equal to max$(2, -2, 8 + 1/8) = 8 + 1/8$  
Absolute minimum is min$(2,-2,8+1/8) = -2$
