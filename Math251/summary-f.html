# Summary, Chapter 16 - Vector Calculus

## Vector Fields

Vector fields are functions that represent vectors for each point in space. They go from a location (vector or multiple variables) to another vector that can represent speed, force, or another vector quantity.

$$\vec F(x,y) = P(x,y)\hat i + Q(x,y)\hat j$$
$$= \langle P(x,y), Q(x,y) \rangle$$
$$\vec F(x,y,z) = P(x,y,z)\hat i + Q(x,y,z)\hat j + R(x,y,z)\hat k$$
$$= \langle P(x,y), Q(x,y), R(x,y) \rangle$$

## [Line Integrals](16/line_integrals.html)

Line integrals represent taking the integral of all the values in a field along a certain path. 

To explain what this means, we are basically taking the value of the function $f$ at each point, represented by some parametric equation $\vec r(t) = \langle x(t), y(t) \rangle$, and multiplying it by the length of the change in $t$ (this is essentially multiplying the force at that point by the portion of the line it influences.)

$$\lim\limits_{\Delta t \to 0}\sum f(x(t), y(t)) |\Delta t|$$

Which leads to the equation

$$\int\limits_C f(x,y)ds = \int\limits_a^b f(x(t), y(t)) |\vec r'(t)| dt$$

This is the line integral with respect to the length (as shown by $|\vec r'(t)|$, normally denoted $ds$). However, the integral can be taken with respect to other variables, or even to multiple.

$$\int\limits_C f(x,y)dx = \int\limits_a^b f(x(t), y(t))\ x'(t)dt$$
$$\int\limits_C f(x,y)dx + g(x,y)dy $$
$$= \int\limits_a^b f(x(t), y(t))\ x'(t)dt + g(x(t), y(t))\ y'(t)dt$$

These can also be represented in 3D:

$$\int\limits_C f(x,y,z)ds = \int\limits_a^b f(x(t), y(t), z(t)) |r'(t)|dt$$

To simplify this for integrals over vector fields, they are shown as the integral over a curve of a vector field:

$$\int\limits_C \vec F \cdot dr$$

This means:

$$\int \vec F(\vec r(t))\vec r'(t)dt$$

Note: the length is cancelled out due to the derivation of this formula. See the notes for more.

### [Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals](16/fund_theorem.html)

Given a conservative vector field $\vec F$, and a function $f$ such that $\nabla f = \vec F$ the integral can be found as:

$$\int\limits_C \vec F dr = f(B) - f(A)$$

Essentially, this means we can find the anti-derivative of a vector field as a function whose gradient is the vector field and evaluate it similar to a normal integral.

This only works for conservative vector fields, which can be found by comparing:

$${\delta P\over\delta y} = {\delta Q\over\delta x}$$

This only works for 2D fields; the full definition will be given below.

To actually find $f$, we just need to take the normal integral of one of the parts and then find what needs to be added to ensure the rest of the parts work.

**Question**  
Find $f$ such that $\nabla f = \vec F$, then find the integral. 

$$\vec F = 3yz + 2x, 3xz, 3xy - 1\langle$$
$$\vec r(t) = \langle 2t, t^2, 3 \rangle$$
$$0 \le t \le 1$$

**Solution**  

First, we take the integral of $P$.

$$\int 3yz + 2x = 3xyz + x^2 + h(y,z)$$

In this case, we use $h(y,z)$ instead of a constant $C$ because a constant with respect to $x$ can be a function of $y$ and $z$. So, now we find what $h(y,z)$ is. One way to do this is to take the derivative with respect to $y$ and $z$ and determine what else is needed, the other is to simply reason it out.

$${d\over dy}(3xyz + x^2 + h(y,z))$$
$$3xz + {dh\over dy} = 3xz$$

Here we can see that the derivative already results in $Q$, so the function with respect to $y$ is constant, meaning only $z$ remains.

$${d\over dz}(3xyz + x^2 + h(z))$$
$$3xy + {dh\over dz} = 3xy - 1$$

So ${dh\over dz} = -1$, meaning $h(z) = -z$. Now we have the full function:

$f = 3xyz + x^2 - z$

To evaluate the integral, we simply plug in the initial and final points:

$$\vec r(0) = \langle 0,0,3\rangle$$
$$\vec r(1) = \langle 2,1,3\rangle$$

So:

$$\int\limits_C F \cdot dr = f(2,1,3) - f(0,0,3)$$
$$= 18 + 4 - 3 - (-3) = 22$$

### [Green's Theorem](16/more_line_int.html)

Green's theorem allows us to convert a line integral into a double integral (for curves in the xy-plane):

$$\int\limits_C F\cdot dr = \iint\limits_D \left({\delta Q\over \delta x} - {\delta P\over \delta y}\right)dxdy$$

Green's Theorem only works when the curve is closed.

## [Curl and Divergence](16/curl_and_divergence.html)

### Curl

Curl is defined as the cross product of $\nabla$ and $\vec F$. It represents the rotation of the movement field (as a vector that represents the axis of rotation).

$$
curl\ \vec F = \nabla \times \vec F = 
\begin{vmatrix}
  \hat i && \hat j && \hat k \\
  P && Q && R \\
  {\delta\over \delta x} && {\delta\over \delta y} && {\delta\over \delta z}
\end{vmatrix}
$$
$$= \left({\delta R\over \delta y}\right) - \left({\delta Q\over \delta z}\right)\hat i + 
\left({\delta P\over \delta z}\right) - \left({\delta R\over \delta x}\right)\hat j + 
\left({\delta Q\over \delta x}\right) - \left({\delta P\over \delta y}\right)\hat k$$

### Divergence

Divergence is defined as the dot product of $\nabla$ and $\vec F$. It represents the movement of a particle away from that point.

$$div\ \vec F = \nabla \cdot \vec F = {\delta P \over\delta x} + {\delta Q \over\delta y} + {\delta R \over\delta z} $$

## [Parametric Surfaces](16/parametric_surfaces.html)

Parametric surfaces are parametric functions of two variables.

$$
\vec r(u,v) = 
\begin{cases}
  x = f(u,v) \\
  y = g(u,v) \\
  z = h(u,v)
\end{cases}
$$

This takes two variables $(u,v)$ and outputs a point in space $(x,y,z)$. This allows for a surface to be created, and is the 2D (surface) equivalent of a line (curve).

**Question**  
Find the equation of the surface with the given parameterization:

$$\vec r(u,v) = \langle v\cos u, v\sin u, v \rangle$$

**Solution**  
To make this easier, convert the parametric equations to a normal equation. To do this, try and convert it to (x,y,z).

This problem becomes much easier when you notice that we can use $x^2 + y^2$ to cancel out the trigonometric functions:

$$x^2 + y^2 = s^2(\cos^2 + \sin^2) = s^2 = z^2$$
$$z^2 = x^2 + y^2$$

This equation represents a paraboloid.

### Surface Areas

We can find the surface area  by summing up the rectangles on the surface of the function. Since the area of these parallelograms can be given as $|side1 \times side2|$, we can represent this as:

$$\iint\limits_D |\vec r_u \times \vec r_v|dA$$

This means the double integral over the domain of $S$ of the length of the cross product of the partial derivatives of $S\ (\vec r(u,v))$.

## [Integrals over Surfaces](16/surface_int.html)

It turns out the previous equation can be extended to general surface integrals, just replacing the function (which is 1 for area) with the function we are integrating:

$$\iint\limits_S f(x,y,z)ds = \iint\limits_D f(\vec r(u,v))|\vec r_u \times \vec r_v|dudv$$

As a side note, if $S$ is the graph of $z = f(x,y)$, then $|\vec r_u \times \vec r_v|$ can be given more simply as:

$$\sqrt{\left({\delta f\over \delta x}\right) + \left({\delta f\over \delta y}\right) + 1}$$

Over a vector field, the equation becomes:

$$\iint\limits_D \vec F \cdot (\vec r_u \times \vec r_v)dudv$$

This is also called **Flux**.

### [Stokes' Theorem](16/stokes_and_diver.html)

Stokes theorem allows us to change a curve integral to a surface integral.

$$\int\limits_C \vec F \cdot dr = \iint\limits_S curl\ \vec F \cdot dS$$

This only works for a closed curve (to make the surface $S$).

### [The Divergence Theorem](16/stokes_and_diver.html)

The divergence theorem allows us to convert a surface integral to a triple integral. It uses divergence in the formula, hence the name:

$$\iint\limits_S \vec F \cdot dS = \iiint\limits_E div\ \vec F\ dV$$
This only works for a closed surface (to make the volume $E$).

Note that $div\ \vec F$ is scalar, so we will not have a vector as an answer.
