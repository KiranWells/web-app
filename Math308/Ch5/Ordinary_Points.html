# Series Solutions Near Ordinary Points

With some linear homogeneous differential equation:

$$P(x)y'' + Q(x)y' + R(x)y = 0$$

If we want to solve it around a point $x_0$, and there is not factor $(x-c)$ which divides into all of $P$, $Q$, and $R$, we can call $x_0$ an **ordinary point** if $P(x_0)\ne 0$, and a **singular point** is $P(x_0)=0$.

~~Example

For the equation $(x^3+x) y'' - 2xy' + x^2y = 0$, find the singular and ordinary points.

First, divide by the common factor $x$:

$$(x^2+1) y'' - 2y' + xy = 0$$

Now, find the roots of $P(x)$ to find the singular points:

$$x^2 + 1 = 0 \to x = \pm i$$

The ordinary points are simply all of the *other* points.

~~

With an ordinary point, then there is an interval containing $x_0$ in which $P(x) \ne 0$, and we can divide by $P(x)$.

## Theorem

If $x_0$ is an ordinary point for the DE:

$$P(x)y'' + Q(x)y' + R(x)y = 0$$

with no common linear factors, then we can always find a fundamental pair of solutions in the form $y = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n(x-x_0)^n$. The radius of convergence of that power series is at least as large as the smallest distance between $x_0$ and the roots of $P(x)$ in the complex plane. In particular, if $P(x)$ is non-zero for all x in complex plane, the radius of convergence is infinite.

Essentially, this means that we can use the series method for any equation with the above form, and the equation used to solve it must use a point $x_0$ where the first coefficient is not $0$. In addition, it shows how reliable those solutions will be (how large the radius of convergence is).

~~Example 1

Find the lower bound for the radius of convergence of the series solutions, centered at $x_0 = -3$ for the DE 
$$(x^3-2x^2+5x)y'' - x^2y' + 2xy=0$$

First, divide by the common factor:

$$(x^2-2x+5)y'' - xy' + 2y=0$$

Then, find the roots of $P(x)$ in the complex plane:

$$x^2 - 2x + 5 = 0 \to x = 1 \pm 2i$$

According to the theorem, the radius of convergence is at least the distance to the nearest root.

$$\rho = dist(x_0, 1 + 2i)$$
$$\rho = \sqrt{4^2 + 2^2} = 2\sqrt{5}$$

~~

~~Example 3

Find a fundamental pair of solutions for the equation:

$$y'' - xy' - 2y = 0$$

in the form of the power series centered at $x_0 = 0$. Check this by evaluating the Wronskian at $x_0$.

In this case, $x_0$ must be ordinary because $P(x) = 1$. In addition, the radius of convergence is infinite as there is no value of $x$, real or complex, that will result in $P(x) = 0$.

Next, to solve te problem, we start with 

$$y = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n$$
$$y' = \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} na_n x^{n-1}$$
$$y'' = \sum\limits_{n=2}^{\infty} n(n-1)a_n x^{n-2}$$

Which results in the equation:

$$
\sum\limits_{n=2}^{\infty} n(n-1)a_n x^{n-2} - 
x\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} na_n x^{n-1} -
2\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n = 0
$$

Then, we change all of the x values to $x^n$ to allow them to be combined.

$$
\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} (n+2)(n+1)a_{n+2} x^{n} - 
\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} na_n x^{n} -
\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n = 0
$$

Now we need to remove the first elements of some sums to get them all to start at the same point:

$$
2a_2 + \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} (n+2)(n+1)a_{n+2} x^{n} - 
\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} na_n x^{n} -
2a_0 - \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n = 0
$$

And combine the series:

$$
(2a_2 -
2a_0) + \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} [(n+2)(n + 1)a_{n+2} - (n+2)a_n] x^n = 0
$$

Now, since we have a polynomial equals 0, we can set all of the coefficients equal to 0.

$$2a_2 - 2a_0 = 0$$
$$a_2 = a_0$$
$$(n+2)(n + 1)a_{n+2} - (n+2)a_n = 0$$
$$a_{n+2} = {(n+2)a_n \over (n+2)(n + 1)}$$
$$a_{n+2} = {a_n \over (n + 1)}$$

For all second-order differential equations, we are given $a_0$ and $a_1$:

$$a_0 = y(0), a_1 = y'(0)$$

Using the above associations, we can get a few of the first coefficients:

$$
\begin{gathered}
  a_2 = a_0 && a_3 = \frac{a_1}{2} \\
  a_4 = \frac{a_0}{3} && a_5 = \frac{a_1}{(2)(4)} \\
  a_6 = \frac{a_0}{(3)(5)} && a_7 = \frac{a_1}{(2)(4)(6)} \\
\end{gathered}
$$

So the formula for evens is:

$$a_{2k} = {a_0 \over (2k-1)(2k-3)...(5)(3)}$$
$$a_{2k+1} = {a_1 \over (2k)(2k-2)...(4)(2)}$$

The denominators are more simply written using a variant of factorials:

$$7! = (7)(6)(5)...(2)(1)$$
$$7!! = (7)(5)(3)(1)$$

So we can write:

$$a_{2k} = {a_0 \over (2k-1)!!}, k \ge 1$$
$$a_{2k+1} = {a_1 \over (2k)!!}, k \ge 1$$

Which results in a solution of:

$$y = a_0 + a_1x + \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} {a_0 \over (2k-1)!!}x^{2k} + \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} {a_1 \over (2k)!!}x^{2k+1}$$

Which can be rearranged as:

$$y = a_0\left(1 + \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} {1 \over (2k-1)!!}x^{2k}\right) + a_1\left(x + \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} {1 \over (2k)!!}x^{2k+1}\right)$$

To find the Wronskian, we simply need to separate $y_1$ and $y_2$ and solve:

$$y_1 = 1 + \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} {1 \over (2k-1)!!}x^{2k}$$
$$y_1' = 0 + \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} {2k \over (2k-1)!!}x^{2k-1}$$
$$y_2 = x + \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} {1 \over (2k)!!}x^{2k+1}$$
$$y_2' = 1 + \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} {2k+1 \over (2k)!!}x^{2k}$$

Taking the value at 0:

$$W = y_1y_2' - y_2y_1' = (1)(1) - (0)(0) = 1$$

Which proves it would work. Similarly, taking the ratio test of the solutions will result in a radius of $\infty$, which agrees with the value predicted by the theorem.
