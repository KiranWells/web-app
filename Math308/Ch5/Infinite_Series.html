# Infinite Series

Remember from calculus that we can often compute infinite series of functions.

$$\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} f(x,n)$$

To remind you about these concepts, here is an example:

~~Example 1

Find the radius of convergence and the interval of convergence of the power series:

$$\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} {(-1)^n(x-3)^n \over n^32^n}$$

Here we can use the ratio test, comparing the nth and n+1th element:

$$\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \left| {f(n+1) \over f(n-1)} \right|$$
$$\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \left|{(-1)^{n+1}(x-3)^{n+1} \over (n+1)^32^{n+1}} \cdot {(-1)^n(x-3)^n \over n^32^n}\right|$$

$$= \left|{x - 3 \over 2}\right|$$

If this is less than one, the series converges absolutely. If it is greater, the series diverges. (At the boundary points, this is inconclusive).

$$\rho = 2, x \in (1,5)$$

~~

## Taylor Series

The Taylor series for any function can be given as:

$$\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} {f^{(n)}(x_0)\over n!}(x - x_0)^n$$

The important idea is whether it converges, and whether it converges to the function. $f$ is said to be **analytic** at x = x_0 if the radius of convergence of its Taylor series is positive. Most of the familiar functions of calculus are analytic. In many cases, the most useful context for power series is the complex plane, but we will not usually involve it.

~~Example 2

Find the Taylor series for $f(x) = 1/x$ at $x_0 = 3$.

So, we start by taking take the first few derivatives of $f$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  f(x) = && x^{-1} \\
  f'(x) = && -x^{-2} \\
  f''(x) = && 2x^{-3} \\
  f^{(3)}(x) = && -6x^{-4} \\
  ... \\
  f^{(n)}(x) = && (-1)^nn!x^{-n-1} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Now we take the Taylor series formula:

$$f(x) = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} {f^{(n)}(x_0)\over n!}(x - x_0)^n$$
$$f(x) = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} {(-1)^nn!3^{-n-1}\over n!}(x - 3)^n$$
$$f(x) = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n3^{-n-1}(x - 3)^n$$

From here we can use the ratio test again:

$$\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \left| {f(n+1) \over f(n-1)} \right|$$
$$\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \left| {(-1)^{n+1}3^{-n-2}(x - 3)^{n+1} \over (-1)^n3^{-n-1}(x - 3)^n} \right| = \left|{x - 3 \over 3}\right|$$

So we can finish the convergence as:

$$\rho = 3, x\in (0,6)$$

~~

There are a few McLaurin (Taylor series when $x_0 = 0$) series that are useful to know:

$$e^x = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!}$$
$$\sin x = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} {(-1)^nx^{2n+1}\over(2n+1)!}$$

~~Example 3

Use the McLaurin series for $e^x$ and $\sin x$ to find the McLaurin series for $e^x\sin x$.

Here, we just multiply the series:

$$e^x\sin x = (1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} ...)(x - \frac{x^3}{3!} ...)$$

These can be multiplied in a grid to make the sum easier to understand:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} ... \\
  + x^2 - \frac{x^4}{3!} ... \\
  + \frac{x^3}{2!} - \frac{x^5}{3!2!} ... \\
\end{aligned}
$$

And we can add them to get the pattern:

$$e^x \sin x = x + x^2 + (\frac{1}{2!}-\frac{1}{3!})x^3 + (-\frac{1}{3!})x^4 ...$$

So if we needed to find $f^{(4)}(0)$ we just need to take the coefficient of the element with $x^4$ because of the definition of the Taylor series.

~~

## Index Shift

We can shift the start of a series simply by changing the n variable:

$$\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} f(x, n) = \sum\limits_{n=m}^{\infty} f(x, n-m) = \sum\limits_{n=m}^{\infty} g(x, n)$$

~~Example 4

Shift the series:

$$\sum\limits_{n=3}^{\infty} {n \over (2n - 1)!}x^{n-2}$$

to $n=1$.

We can take the first few elements and then get to a new pattern:

$$\frac{3}{5!}x + \frac{4}{7!}x^2 ...$$

If we start at 1 instead of 3, we can represent this series as:

$${n + 2 \over (2(n+2) - 1)!}x^{n}$$

$$\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} {n + 2 \over (2(n+2) - 1)!}x^{n}$$

If we wanted to change to $n=-10$, we can try $n + 13$:

$$\sum\limits_{n=-10}^{\infty} {n + 13 \over (2(n+13) - 1)!}x^{n+11}$$

Note that if you write out this series, you will get the same as the beginning. This is exactly what we wanted.

~~

~~Example 5


$$\sum\limits_{n=2}^{\infty} n(n-1)a_nx^{n-2} - x\sum\limits_{n=0} a_nx^n$$

The important part of this equation is to try to represent it as a differential equation. If you consider the second sum as $y$, you may notice that the second represents the second derivative of $y$ (because the power is two less and the coefficients are the previous powers).

We get:

$$y'' - xy$$

Which set equal to 0 is the **Airy Equation**, which is incredibly hard to solve.

In series form, we can try to simplify the left side to get only $x^n$. This would require a shift of +2, changing the n to 0:

$$\sum\limits_{n=2}^{\infty} n(n-1)a_nx^{n-2} = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} (n+2)(n+1)a_{n+2}x^{n}$$

Taking the second one, we can multiply the x in and shift to $n=1$:

$$x\sum\limits_{n=0} a_nx^n = \sum\limits_{n=0} a_nx^{n+1} = \sum\limits_{n=1} a_{n-1}x^n$$

Taking the first element out of the first one, we can move both sums to the same starting point:

$$\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} (n+2)(n+1)a_{n+2}x^{n} - \sum\limits_{n=1} a_{n-1}x^n$$
$$= 2a_2 + \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} [(n+2)(n+1)a_{n+2} - a_{n-1}]x^n$$

This can now be more simply solved.

~~

## Solving Differential Equations as Series

Many complex differential equations can be solved by changing them into power series and then solving for a general formula of $y$. As a preview example, please see the following example.

~~ extra example

Solve the Airy equation by the series method:

$$y''-xy = 0$$

First, set up:

$$y = \sum\limits_{n=0} a_nx^n$$

We can take the derivatives:

$$y' = \sum\limits_{n=1} na_nx^{n-1}$$
$$y'' = \sum\limits_{n=2} n(n-1)a_nx^{n-2}$$

Shifting the start because the first few results are 0. Then, we can write the equation as:

$$\sum\limits_{n=2}^{\infty} n(n-1)a_nx^{n-2} - x\sum\limits_{n=0} a_nx^n$$

Taking the value which we reached in [Example 5](#Example-5):

$$2a_2 + \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} [(n+2)(n+1)a_{n+2} - a_{n-1}]x^n = 0$$

This has now become a power series representation of the zero function, so all of the coefficients must be 0.

$$a_2 = 0, (n+2)(n+1)a_{n+2} - a_{n-1} = 0$$

Notice that the second equation is *recursive*.

$$a_{n+2} = {a_{n-1}\over (n+2)(n+1)}$$

So, taking the first few elements of $n$ starting at where the sum starts:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  (n = 1) && a_3 = \frac{a_0}{(3)(2)} \\
  (n = 2) && a_4 = \frac{a_1}{(4)(3)} \\
  (n = 3) && a_5 = \frac{a_2}{(5)(4)} = 0 \\
  ... \\
  (n = 6) && a_8 = \frac{a_5}{(8)(7)} = 0 \\
  ...
\end{aligned}
$$

But for a second order equation, we only need two coefficients (the initial conditions), the rest will be dependent on them (aside from the ones which are 0 due to $a_2$).

$$a_{3n+2} = 0$$

The rest are dependent on $a_1$ and $a_0$:

$$a_{3n} \leftarrow a_0$$
$$a_{3n+1} \leftarrow a_1$$

Taking the $a_0$ chain:

$$a_3 = \frac{a_0}{(3)(2)}$$
$$a_6 = \frac{a_3}{(6)(5)} = \frac{a_0}{(6)(5)(3)(2)}$$

$$a_{3n} = {a_0 \over (3n)(3n-1)(3n-3)(3n-4)...(3)(2)}$$

We can do the same for the $a_1$ chain:

$$a_{3n+1} = {a_1 \over (3n+1)(3n)(3n-2)(3n-3)...(4)(3)}$$

Remember that these formulas are useful for $n \ge 1$, as that was the domain of the sum.

We ca use these equations for a new sum function for y:

$$
y(x) =
\begin{aligned}
  a_0[1 + {x^3 \over (3)(2)} + {x^6 \over (6)(5)(3)(2)} ...] \\
+ a_1[x + {x^4\over (4)(3)} + {x^7 \over (7)(6)(4)(3)} ...]
\end{aligned}
$$

Which can be written as a summation:

$$
y(x) =
\begin{aligned}
 a_0\left(1 + \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} {x^{3n} \over (3n)(3n-1)(3n-3)(3n-4)...(3)(2)}\right) \\
 + a_1\left(x+\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} {x^{3n+1} \over (3n+1)(3n)(3n-2)(3n-3)...(4)(3)}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Which is the famous series solution to the Airy equation:

$$y(x) = a_0Ai(x) + a_1Bi(x)$$

Where $a_0 = y(0)$ and $a_1 = y'(0)$, which can be seen from the definition of series or writing out the solution of the initial sum for $y$.

One other test we can do is to see when these series will converge. To start, let's try the ratio test:

$$\lim\limits_{n \to \infty}\left| {x^{3n+3} \over (3n + 1)(3n)(3n-1)(3n-3)...(4)(3)} {(3n)(3n-1)(3n-3)(3n-4)...(3)(2) \over x^{3n} } \right| \lt 1$$

This will equal 0, so it is true for all x.

In addition, we can take the wronskian at 0 with some simplification, and it will result in 1. This proves that they are a fundamental pair of solutions.
