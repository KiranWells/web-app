# Differences between Linear and Nonlinear Equations

## Existence and Uniqueness of DEs

For all linear equations, we are trying to determine:
1. Does a solution to the equation exist?
2. How many are there? (Is it unique)

### Linear Equations

We have already found a solution for these equations:

$$y' + p(t)y = g(t), y(t_0) = y_0$$

This is summarized in a formula:

#### Theorem:
If the function $p$ and $g$ are continuous on an open interval $I = \alpha \lt t \lt \beta$ containing $t_0$, the solution is given by:

$$y = \frac{1}{\mu(t)}\left[y_0 + \int_{t_0}^t \mu(s)g(s)ds\right]$$

Where:

$$\mu(t) = e^{\int_{t_0}^t p(s)ds}$$

~~Example 1

Find an interval in which the solution of the initial value problem:

$$(t^2 - 2t - 3)y' - t^3y = e^{2t}\ln(t), y(2) = 7$$

is certain to exist, and whether it is unique.

First, we need to change it into standard form:

$$y' - {t^3\over t^2 - 2t - 3}y = {e^{2t}\ln(t)\over t^2 - 2t - 3}$$

Now, to determine the interval, we need to verify that $p$ and $g$ are continuous. (Those are the conditions for the theorem.) Clearly, they do not work when $t^2 - 2t - 3 = 0$, so our interval is between any of those solutions:

$(t - 3)(t + 1) = 0$
$t = 3, -1$

Secondly, we need to ensure $t > 0$ as $\ln(t)$ is only valid for these values:

So since the initial value is in between these points, our interval is from $(0, 3)$.

There is no need to solve this for a general solution!

### Non-linear Equations

For these types of equations, we need to use a different theorem:

#### Theorem
If $f$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ are continuous in some rectangular interval $R = \alpha \lt t \lt \beta, \gamma \lt y \lt \delta$ containing the point $(t_0, y_0)$, in some interval $t_0 - h \lt t \lt t_0 + h$ contained on the larger interval $R$, there is a unique solution of the initial value problem:

$$y' = f(t,y), y(t_0) = y_0$$

However, the existence, but not the uniqueness, can be established on the continuity of $f$ alone.

If the initial rectangle has $(t_0,y_0)$ as its center, then $h$ can be taken to be at least as large as:

$$h = min(a,b/M)$$

Where $M$ is the maximum (or upper bound) of $|f|$ on the rectangle, and $a,b$ are the distances from the center to the sides of $t,y$ respectively. So, if the rectangle is from $t_0 - a \lt t \lt t_0 + a, y_0 - b \lt t \lt y_0 + b$, we can use the above formula.

This is a much more complex definition, which shows us how hard to study non-linear equations are.

~~Example 2

In the following problems separate out domains in the plane in which the given ODE has unique solutions.

1. $y' = t^2 + y^2$  
    This is continuous everywhere, so it will have unique solutions everywhere.
2. $y' = {\cot(t)y\over y^2 - t^2}$  
    $f$ is only continuous if:
    $$
    \begin{cases}
      y^2 + t^2 \ne 0 \\
      \sin t \ne 0
    \end{cases}
    $$
    So, we just need to be in some area that lies between those lines. We also need to ensure the derivatives are not invalid, but after differentiating, we can see that the points of discontinuity are the same.

3. $y' = \sqrt[3]{3x - y - 1}$  
    In this case, $f$ is continuous (which guarantees the existence of a solution), but $f_y$ is not when:
    $$
      3x - y - 1 = 0
    $$

~~

~~Example 3

In each problem, find a value for h such that a unique solution $y = \phi(x)$ with $\phi(0) = 0$ is certain to exist in the interval $-h \lt x \lt h$

1. $y' = x^2 + y^2$

This is a famous equation (Riccati)

We can test at 0 and see that the function has an $x^3$-like slope pattern.

Since this is continuous for all x, y, we can see that it exists everywhere, and since the derivative is also continuous, it will be unique.

But, how far will the solution be valid for? This is the $h$ value, and is extremely hard to determine. In most cases, we can only find a lower bound, defined by the theorem:

> If the initial rectangle has $(t_0,y_0)$ as its center, then $h$ can be taken to be at least as large as:
> $$h = min(a,b/M)$$
> Where $M$ is the maximum (or upper bound) of $|f|$ on the rectangle, and $a,b$ are the distances from the center to the sides of $t,y$ respectively. So, if the rectangle is from $t_0 - a \lt t \lt t_0 + a, y_0 - b \lt t \lt y_0 + b$, we can use the above formula.

So, to find the biggest bound for $h$, we want to find the smallest $M$:

So, for a rectangle of $(a,b)$:

$$|f| = |x^2 + y^2| = \le 2 = M$$

So, to get the best $h$, we need to get the largest $(a,b)$ while still minimizing $M$.

2. $y' = \sin(x - y)$

The slope at $(0,0)$ also will be 1, and both $f$ and $f_y$ are continuous, so there is a unique solution passing through $(0,0)$.

Comparing the max of the function will show:

$$|\sin (x-y)| \le M = 1$$

Now, if we use a substitution strategy using $z = x - y$ and $\int {du\over 1-\sin(u)} = \tan(\frac{u}{2} + \frac{\pi}{4})$:

So we can start to solve:

$$
\begin{cases}
  y' = \sin(x-y) \\
  y(0) = 0
\end{cases}
$$

This is non-separable, so we try change of variables. The independent variable is $x$, and the dependent is $y$, which we are changing to $z$:

Here, we can solve for y and differentiate:

$$z= x - y \to y = x - z$$
$$y' = 1 - \frac{dz}{dx}$$

Then set the two equations equal to each other:

$$\sin(z) = 1 - z'$$
$$z' = 1 - \sin(z)$$

Here, we can see how we use the given integral:

$${z'\over 1 - \sin(z)} = 1$$
$${tan(\frac{z}{2} + \frac{\pi}{4}) = x + C$$

Since $\phi(0) = 0$, we can plug that in:

$${tan(\frac{0}{2} + \frac{\pi}{4}) = 0 + C$$
$$C = 1$$

Here, if we solve for $z$, we get:

$$z = \frac{\pi}{s} - 2\arctan(x + 1)$$

And we plug $z$ back in:

$$x - y = \frac{\pi}{s} - 2\arctan(x + 1)$$
$$y = x - \frac{\pi}{s} + 2\arctan(x + 1)$$

And the validity is for all $x$, since arctan is defined for all $x$.

~~

One important note is that for non-linear equations, $y_0$ changes the interval of validity.

~~Example 4

Solve the IVP:

$$y' = 2ty^2, y(0) = y_0$$

So, we separate variables and integrate:

$${y'\over y^2} = 2t$$
$$\int\limits_{y_0}^y {\mu'\over \mu^2} = \int\limits_0^t 2s$$

Where $s$ and $\mu$ are dummy variables (just an arbitrary name), and we use definite integrals to show how $y_0$ will be used in the function, and avoid solving for $C$:

$$-\frac{1}{\mu}|_{y_0}^y = s^2|_0^t$$
$$-\frac{1}{y}+ -\frac{1}{y_0} = t^2$$

However, since we are dividing by $y$, we need to test $y_0 = 0$. This is in fact a solution, and using the existence and uniqueness theorem, we can show it is unique. It also is valid for all values of $t$.

$$y = -{1\over t^2 - \frac{1}{y_0}}$$

This is only valid if $t^2 - \frac{1}{y_0}$. So, the interval ov validity depends on $y_0$. If $y_0$ is $\lt 0$, then it is valid for all $t$. If it is positive, we solve for $t$ and those are the new limits (if $t_0 = 0$ as we are given.)

$$
\begin{cases}
  R | y_0 \lt 0 \\
  (\sqrt{\frac{1}{y_0}}, -\sqrt{\frac{1}{y_0}}) | y_0 \gt 0
\end{cases}
$$
