# Uses of a Wronskian

Remember that two constants are linearly dependent if they are proportional; meaning that there is some combination of constants that will satisfy:

$$c_1y_1 + c_2y_2 = 0$$
$$c_1^2 + c_2^2 \ne 0$$

~~Example
$y_1 = t$ and $y_2 = 2t$ are linearly dependent, as are $y=0$ and any other function.

However, $sin(t)$ and $cos(t)$ are not, because it can be shown that for the equation to be true, both constants must be zero, which is not allowed.
~~

Importantly, the Wronskian function will be identical to $0$ for any two linearly dependent functions. This means we can evaluate the Wronskian to prove that a function is **non-linear**. Note that the wronskian being $0$ does not prove that two functions are not linearly dependent, as a pair of functions can be non-linearly-dependent, but still having a zero wronskian.

~~Example
The functions $t^2$ and $t|t|$ have a $0$ wronskian, but are not linearly dependent as there is not one constant that will change one to the other.

## Abel's Theorem

~~a note about Abel
Abel was a brilliant mathematician who died very young, and in Norway, there is a mathematics award named after him. (Similar to the Nobel Prize for science.)
~~

If $y_1$ and $y_2$ are solutions of the diff EQ

$$y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y = 0$$

And $p$ and $q$ are continuous over some interval, then the Wronskian for that interval is of the form:

$$W[y_1,y_2] = ce^{-\int p(t)}$$

Not that this shows that if the Wronskian is not $0$, it is *always* non-zero, for all t.

The proof is just to show that the Wronskian satisfies the DE $W' + p(t)W = 0$, thsn the solution of that equation is $W = ce^{-\int p(t)}$.

*Make sure not to confuse this with the integrating factor; $\mu = e^{\int p}$.*

~~Example 4

Find the wronskian of any two solutions of the ODE:

$$t^2y'' - ty' - 8y = 0$$

This standardized will be:

$$'' - t^{-1}y' - 8t^{-2}y = 0$$

Here, $p(t) = t^{-1}$, so we can find the Wronskian as:

$$W[y_1,y_2] = ce^{-\int p(t)} = ce^{-\int \frac{1}{t}}$$
$$= ce^{\ln t}= ct$$

The $c$ will depend on $y_1$ and $y_2$.

From Example 3 in Homogeous Equations, we know that the $W$ of $1/t^4$ and $t^4$ is $6t$, so we can use those here.

~~

~~Example 5

$$xy'' + 4y' + \sin(x^2)y = 0$$

Even though we do not have a formula for $y_1$ and $y_2$, we can still find the wronskian using Abel's formula.

$$=ce^{-\int p} = ce^{-4\ln x} = cx^{-4}$$

This shows that even with an extremely hard-to solve problem, we can easily find a $W$. Given an IVP for the $W$ function, we can solve for $c$ as well.

~~

This ability to find the wronskian of a function is associated with the **Fundamental Set of Solutions** Theorem, as a non-zero wronskian will prove that there is a pair of solutions that can be combined linearly to get a solution.

Given a linear, homogenous equation:

$$y'' + p(t)y' + g(t)y = 0$$

If $p,q$ are continuous over some interval $I$, and a pair of functions given by two separate inital conditions, and the Wronskian is non-zero, then the inear combination of these is the solution to the equation. We can find a way to solve for $c_1$ and $c_2$ by:

$$
\begin{cases}
  c_1y_1(t_0) + c_2y_2(T_0) = y_0 \\
  c_1y_1'(t_0) + c_2y_2'(T_0) = y_0'
\end{cases}
$$

This also explains why the Wronskian is what it is: it is simply a determinant made up of this system of equations.
