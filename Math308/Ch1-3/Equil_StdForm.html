# Standard form

For linear, first-order equations, we can display the equation as the general form:

$$y' + p(t)y = g(t)$$

The useful thing with these problems is that we can manipulate it to get a product rule, then integrate.

$$f(t)y' + f(t)p(t)y = f(t)g(t)$$

Where $f'(t) = f(t)p(t)$

This $f(t)$ can be found by following a strategy mentioned previously:

$$f'(t) = f(t)p(t)$$
$${f'(t)\over f(t)} = p(t)$$
$$\int {f'(t)\over f(t)}dt = \int p(t)dt$$
$$ln|f(t)| = \int p(t)dt$$
$$f(t) = e^{\int p(t)dt}$$

Question 1:
Solve the differential equation

$$\cos(t)y' - \sin(t)y = t^2$$ 

If you notice that the left side follows the pattern:

$$f(t)y' - f'(t)y$$

We can use the product rule to find:

$$y\cos(t) = \int t^2dt$$ 
$$y\cos(t) = \frac{1}{3} t^3 + C$$ 
$$y = {\frac{1}{3} t^3 + C\over \cos(t)}$$ 

One note is that this solution is only valid when $\cos(t) \ne 0$

Question 2:
Solve the differential equation

$$y' - 2ty = t$$ 

Here, we do not have a normal product rule, but we can manipulate it to get a product rule.

In this case, we can multiply both sides by $e^{-t^2}$ to get a product rule:

$$e^{-t^2}y' - 2te^{-t^2}y = te^{-t^2}$$ 
$$ye^{-t^2} = -\frac{1}{2}e^{-t^2} + C$$
$$y = Ce^{t^2-\frac{1}{2}}$$

In these type of problems, the function $\mu(t)$ which we multiply the entire equation with is called the integrating factor.

$$y'(t) + p(t)y(t) = g(t)$$
$$\mu(t)y'(t) + \mu(t)p(t)y(t) = \mu(t)g(t)$$
$$\frac{d}{dx}[\mu(t)y(t)] = \mu(t)g(t)$$
$$\mu(t)y(t) = \int \mu(t)g(t) dt + C$$

As I mentioned in the previous section, we can easily find this integrating factor as:

$$\mu(t) = e^{\int p(t)dt}$$

Question 3:
Solve the ODE $ty' - y = t^3e^{3t}$. 

We can follow the standard strategy for this one, just finding the integrating factor.

$$y' - \frac{1}{t}y = t^2e^{3t}$$ 
$$p(t) =  - \frac{1}{t}$$ 
$$\mu(t) = e^{\int p(t)dt}$$
$$\mu(t) = e^{\int - \frac{1}{t}dt}$$
$$\mu(t) = e^{-ln|t|}$$
$$\mu(t) = e^{ln|t^{-1}|}$$
$$\mu(t) = t^{-1}$$

$$\frac{1}{t}y' - \frac{1}{t^2}y = te^{3t}$$ 
$$\frac{1}{t}y = \int te^{3t} dt$$

To integrate this, we need to use integration by parts:

$$
\begin{matrix}
  u = t  && v = \frac{1}{3}e^{3t} \\
  du = 1 && dv = e^{3t} \\
\end{matrix}
$$

$$\int udv = uv - \int vdu$$
$$\int te^{3t} dt = t\frac{1}{3}e^{3t} - \int \frac{1}{3}e^{3t}dt$$
$$\int te^{3t} dt = t\frac{1}{3}e^{3t} - \frac{1}{9}e^{3t} + C$$

So:

$$\frac{1}{t}y = \frac{1}{3}te^{3t} - \frac{1}{9}e^{3t} + C$$
$$y = \frac{1}{3}t^2e^{3t} - \frac{1}{9}te^{3t} + Ct$$
$$y = \frac{1}{9}e^{3t}(3t^2 - t) + Ct$$

Question 4:
Compare the number of solutions of the following three initial value problems for the previous ODE.

I thought this example was particularly interesting, so the question is not paraphrased. However, I believe there was an arithmetic error in the notes, so these answers may differ slightly.

1. $y(1) = 1$
2. $y(0) = 1$
3. $y(0) = 0$

To solve this, we simply need to plug the values in:

1:  
$$y = \frac{1}{9}e^{3t}(3t^2 - t) + Ct$$
$$1 = \frac{1}{9}e^{3}(3 - 1) + C$$
$$1 = \frac{2}{9}e^{3} + C$$
$$1 - \frac{2}{9}e^{3} = C$$

So for this one, we get only one solution.

2:  
$$y = \frac{1}{9}e^{3t}(3t^2 - t) + Ct$$
$$1 = \frac{1}{9}e^{0}(0 - 0) + C0$$
$$1 = 0$$

There are no solutions.

2:  
$$y = \frac{1}{9}e^{3t}(3t^2 - t) + Ct$$
$$0 = \frac{1}{9}e^{0}(0 - 0) + C0$$
$$0 = 0$$

This is true for all values of C, so it has infinite solutions.

For any solution, the **interval of validity** of the solution is the largest continuous interval containing the initial value in which the solution remains differentiable.

~~Example 5

Solve and find the internal validity of the solution.

$$y' + (\cot x)y = 5e^{\cos{x}}, y(\pi/2) = -4$$

Since this is already in standard form, we can simply follow the steps:

$$p(t) = \cot x$$
$$\int p(t) = \int \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \ln|\sin x|$$

$$\mu = e^{\ln|\sin x|} = \sin x$$

$$y' + (\cot x)y = 5e^{\cos{x}}$$
$$\sin xy' + \sin x(\cot x)y = 5\sin xe^{\cos{x}}$$
$$\sin xy = \int 5\sin xe^{\cos{x}}$$
$$\sin xy = - 5e^{\cos{x}} + C$$

And now we solve the initial value problem:

$$\sin(\pi/2)(-4) = -5e^{\cos(\pi/2)} + C$$
$$(-4) = -5 + C$$
$$1 = C$$

$$\sin xy = - 5e^{\cos{x}} + 1$$
$$y = {- 5e^{\cos{x}} + 1\over \sin x}$$

This is only valid when the denominator is not 0, meaning $\sin x \ne 0$, so 0 and any multiple of $\pi$ is not valid.

Therefore, the interval around $\pi/2$ that is valid is from $0$ to $\pi$.
