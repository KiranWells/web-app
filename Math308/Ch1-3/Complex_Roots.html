# Complex roots of the Characteristic Equation 

Remember that for en equation

$$ay'' + by' + cy = 0$$

Where $a,b,c$ are constants, we can find a solution with the substitution $y = e^{rt}$:

$$ar^2 + br + c = 0$$

Originally, we could only use *real* solutions, but here we will consider *complex* solutions of the form:

$$r_1 = \alpha + i\beta, r_2 = \alpha - i\beta$$
$$r = \alpha \pm i\beta$$

Where:

$$\alpha = -\frac{b}{2a}$$
$$\beta = {\sqrt{4ac - b^2} \over 2a}$$

Euler's formula explains a relationship between real and complex numbers:

$$e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i\sin \theta$$

<aside>

This shows that: $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$

</aside>

Using this identity, we can substitute these solutions as:

$$y_1 = e^{(\alpha + i\beta)t} = e^{\alpha t}e^{i\beta t} = e^{\alpha t}[\cos(\beta t) + i\sin(\beta t)]$$
$$y_2 = e^{(\alpha - i\beta)t} = e^{\alpha t}e^{-i\beta t} = e^{\alpha t}[\cos(\beta t) - i\sin(\beta t)]$$

Notice that $y_2$ is the conjugate of $y_1$, or:

$$y_2 = \bar y_1$$

We can use this to get real values by defining two different functions separating the real and imaginary parts:

$$u_1 = e^{\alpha t}\cos(\beta t) = {y_1 + y_2 \over 2}$$
$$u_2 = e^{\alpha t}\sin(\beta t) = {y_1 - y_2 \over 2i}$$

Now since these are just a linear combination of two solutions to this function, these functions are also valid solutions of the equation. Since these are also both real, we can use them as the solution.

$$
W = 
\begin{vmatrix}
  e^{\alpha t}\cos(\beta t) && e^{\alpha t}\sin(\beta t) \\
  \alpha e^{\alpha t}\cos(\beta t) - \beta e^{\alpha t}\sin(\beta t) && \alpha e^{\alpha t}\sin(\beta t) + \beta e^{\alpha t}\cos(\beta t)
\end{vmatrix}
$$
$$= \beta e^{2\alpha t} \ne 0 \because \beta \ne 0$$

Also, not that the wronskian of these functions is not 0, so it is a valid fundamental set.

$$y = c_1u_1 + c_2u_2 = c_1e^{\alpha t}\cos(\beta t) + c_2e^{\alpha t}\sin(\beta t)$$

Given an operator $L[y]$, which is a second order linear differential equation and modifies it in some way, where it is a function of that equation:

$$L[y] = a(t)y'' + b(t)y'+c(t)y$$

If $y$ is a function of $t$, then so is $L$:

$$L[y] = g(t)$$

So, if $y$ is an complex valued function; one which has a real and imaginary function, then $g$ may also have a complex value, and so will $L$. This means we can separate it into different parts:

$$L[y_1] + iL[y_2] = g_1(t) + ig_2(t)$$

Notice that the operator $L$ is the same, meaning that our explanation above, where we found an imaginary and real part, can be compared to $g_1$ and $g_2$, showing it is a real solution:

$$L[u_1 + iu_2] = L[u_1] + iL[u_2] = 0 \rightrightarrows y$$

This can be done as $L$ is a **linear** operator, meaning that constants can be taken out. 

So we end up with a solution:


$$y = c_1u_1 + c_2u_2 = c_1e^{\alpha t}\cos(\beta t) + c_2e^{\alpha t}\sin(\beta t)$$
$$=e^{\alpha t}[c_1\cos(\beta t) + c_2\sin(\beta t)]$$

Which will be periodic and may be exponentially growing.

~~Example 1

$$y'' + 2y' + 5y = 0$$

The solution for $r$ gives: $-1 \pm 2i$, which means we need to use the special solution:

$$\alpha = -1; \beta = 2$$

$$y = e^{\alpha t}[c_1\cos(\beta t) + c_2\sin(\beta t)]$$
$$y = e^{- t}[c_1\cos(2 t) + c_2\sin(2 t)]$$

And in an Initial value problem, the full equation could easily be found with the derivative.

~~

~~Example 2

Find values of $k$ for which $y'' + ky' + y = 0$ are periodic. This means that it does not grow or shrink in magnitude as $t$ increases. Then find the general solution.

For this to be purely oscillating, the value of $\alpha$ must be 0, and since (using the quadratic equation)

$$\alpha = -b/2a \to b = 0 \to k = 0$$

This means that the equation becomes:

$$y'' + y = 0$$

So, $r^2 + 1 = 0$, and $r = \pm i$

$$y = c_1\cos(t) + c_2\sin(t)$$

~~

~~Example 3 

Find a homogenous linear ODE with constant coefficients such that:

$$3e^{-2t}\cos(\sqrt{3}t)-7e^{-2t}\sin(\sqrt{3}t)$$

is a solution.

This is working backwards from a solution, so we are trying to find a quadratic equation where the roots are:

$$r = -2 \pm i\sqrt{3}$$

By rearranging and squaring, we can work backwards to $r^2$:

$$(r + 2)^2 = -3 \to r^2 + 4r + 4 = -3 \to r^2 + 4r + 7$$

Which gives the equation:

$$y'' + 4y' + 7y = 0$$
