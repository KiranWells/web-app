# What are Differential Equations?

## Definition

A **differential equation** (DE) is an equation involving derivatives of an unknown function up to a certain order.

This convoluted definition means that it is an equation where the variables are the equation itself ($y$) and its derivatives ($y'$). There may be a normal variable ($t$), usually time.

If there is no variable $t$ explicitly, it is called an autonomous equation. Examples:

Non-autonomous: (note the $t$)

$$y - y'' + t = 0$$

Autonomous:

$$y = y''$$

Many differential equations are impossible to solve, even if they look fairly trivial. For example, $y'' - xy = 0$ is simple, but unsolvable.

  This equation will need to use some fundamental functions to solve:

$$y_1 = Ai(x)$$
$$y_2 = Bi(x)$$

Which are solutions, but do not actually have a normal representations. 
(We will explain these more later)

An ordinary DE, ODE, is a DE with only one independent var. A partial DE, PDE, is a DE involving the partial derivatives of a function. Ex:

$$u_t = u_{xx}$$

This class will not be focused on PDEs.

Example 1:
Verify that $u(x,t) = e^{-t}\sin x$ is a solution to the PDE $u_t = u_{xx}$. (Note, this is autonomous)

$$u_t = -e^{-t}\sin x$$

$$u_x = e^-t\cos x$$
$$u_xx = -e^-t\sin x$$

Therefore, this is a solution.

More importantly, can we use this to find other examples that work?

You may notice that this also works for $\cos x$, since it also creates a negative after two derivatives.

In addition, you could add a constant in front, or in front of t and x, as long as one is equal to the other squared and negated.

This is the essential idea of differential equations. There is not just one solution, but many, and we need to consider how to match a pattern, not finding a single solution.

Example 2:
Find 2 solutions of the ODE $y'' 4y = 0$ that are independent (not a multiple of each other). Then, try and find the most general form of the solution.

One solution is $\sin 2x$, and $\cos 2x$ is also a solution.

We can make this more general by stating that $y = C_1 \cos(2x) + C_2 \sin(2x)$. If you plug this in, you will notice that it will always work.

Many equations are non-linear, meaning that you cannot linearly combine solutions for them as in the example above. They cannot even be scaled sometimes.

(Side note: non-linear ones are often the 'fun' ones, but they are often avoided in education.)

Example 3:
Find all solutions of the form $y = e^{rt}$ for the DE $y''' - y'' - 6y' = 0$. 

The strategy of using $y = e^{rt}$ was introduced by Euler.

$$y' = re^{rt}$$
$$y'' = r^2e^{rt}$$
$$y''' = r^3e^{rt}$$

$$e^{rt}(r^3 - r^2 -6r) = 0$$

Keep in mind that a differential equation is supposed to hold true for all values of $t$.
Therefore, we are not solving for $t$, we are solving for $y(t)$. In this case, we can do that by finding $r$.

Therefore, we cannot assume that $e^{rt} = 0$, so we set the rest $= 0$

$$r^3 - r^2 - 6r = 0$$
$$r(r^2 - r - 6) = 0$$
$$r(r + 2)(r - 3) = 0$$
$$r = 0, 3, -2$$

So, we can find $y$:

$$y = e^{0t}$$
$$y = e^{-2t}$$
$$y = e^{3t}$$

This equation is also linear, so we can create a general solution by linearly combining these:

$$y = C_i + C_2e^{3t} + C_3e^{-2t}$$

Note that $e^{0t} = 1$, so we omit it in the equation.

</details>

This is also highly related to Euler's identity.

Example 4:
Find all solutions of the form $y = x^\alpha$ for the DE $x^2y'' = y$ for $x > 0$.

Here we can use another general strategy:

$y = x^\alpha$
$y = \alpha x^{\alpha - 1}$
$y = \alpha(\alpha - 1) x^{\alpha - 2}$

</details>

One thing to note is that we are getting 3 solutions for an order 3, and 2 for an order 2. This is a general rule.
