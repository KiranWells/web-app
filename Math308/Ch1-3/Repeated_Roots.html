# Repeated Roots and Reduction of Order

Given a homogenous differential equation

$$ay'' + by' + cy = 0$$

In the case that the two roots given by substituting $y=e^{rt}$ are the same, assuming that $b^2 - 4ac = 0$, we have:

$$r_1 = r_2 = -\frac{b}{2a}$$

And the general solution is given by:

$$y = c_1 e^{r_1t}+ c_2te^{r_1t}$$

or:

$$y = e^{rt}(c_1 + c_2t)$$

Notice that $y_2$, or the second part of the solution, is $te^t$ instead of just $e^t$

This $t$ is explained by the reduction of order process described in [Example 3](#example-3).

~~Example 1

$$y'' + 6y' + 9y = 0,\ y(1)=2,\ y'(1) = -1$$

Solving r gives:

$$r^2 + 6r + 9 = 0 \to r = -3$$

So:
$$y = c_1 e^{r_1t}+ c_2te^{r_1t}$$
$$y = c_1 e^{-3t}+ c_2te^{-3t}$$
$$y = e^{-3t}(c_1 + c_2 t)$$

$$y' = -3e^{-3t}(c_1 + c_2t) + e^{-3t}(c_2)$$

And solcing the IVP:

$$2 = e^{-3}(c_1 + c_2)$$

$$-1 = -3e^{-3}(c_1 + c_2) + e^{-3}(c_2)$$

Substitution then gives:

$$-1 = -3(2) + e^{-3}(c_2)$$
$$5 = e^{-3}(c_2)$$
$$c_2 = 5e^3$$

And solving for $c_1$ is simple.

## Reduction of Order

If we have one non-zero solution of $y_1(t)$ of the ODE:

$$y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y = 0$$

We can find a second solution 

Reduction of order searches for a second solution $y_2$ by finding some equation for it.

One way to do this is using Abel's Theorem, as the Wronskian is a function of $y_1$ and $y_2$. This maeans we can manipluate the formula to solve for y_2 as follows:

$$W[y_1, y_2] = y_1y_2' - y_1'y_2 = c e^{-\int p(t)dt}$$

Which we can simplify by stating that $c=1$ because the constants that modify $y_1$ and $y_2$ can be manipulated in a way that will cause it to be 1, meaning that it can be ignored.

$${y_1y_2' - y_1'y_2 \over y_1^2} = {e^{-\int p(t)dt}\over y_1^2}$$

And since the left side is just the quotient rule:

$$\frac{d}{dt}\left({y_2 \over y_1}\right) = {e^{-\int p(t)dt}\over y_1^2}$$
$${y_2 \over y_1} = \int {e^{-\int p(t)dt}\over y_1^2}$$
$${y_2} = y_1 \int {e^{-\int p(t)dt}\over y_1^2}$$

### Liouville's Formula

This formula is called the **Liouville formula**.

This works beacuse $y_1$ is already known, allowing us to find a known function of $t$ and integrating it.

This also guarantees that the new function will be linearly independent, as the Wronskian is not zero.

~~another method

One other way of solving this is defining:

$$v(t) = \int {e^{-\int p(t)dt}\over y_1^2}$$

Which allows you to show $y_2 = v(t) y_1$ and substitute this into the original equation for y.

After some math and rearranging, this gives:

$$v''y_1 + v'(2y_1' + py_1) = 0$$

Which, if we define $w = v'$, can be converted into a *first-order* equation, which is simple to solve.

However, this takes a lot of time and it would be simpler to just use the Liouville formula.

~~

~~Example 2

$$2t^2y''+ty - 3y=0$$

Given that $y_1(t) = 1/t$ is a solution.

Standardizing this gives:

$$y'' + \frac{t}{2t^2}y' - \frac{3}{2t^2}y =0$$

Using the formula gives:

$${y_2} = y_1 \int {e^{-\int p(t)dt}\over y_1^2}$$
$${y_2} = \frac{1}{t} \int {e^{-\int \frac{1}{2t}}\over \left(\frac{1}{t}\right)^2}$$
$${y_2} = \frac{1}{t} \int {e^{-\frac{1}{2}\ln{t}}\over \left(\frac{1}{t}\right)^2}$$
$${y_2} = \frac{1}{t} \int {t^{-\frac{1}{2}}\over t^{-2}}$$
$${y_2} = \frac{1}{t} \int {t^{\frac{3}{2}}}$$
$${y_2} = \frac{1}{t} \frac{2}{5}{t^{\frac{5}{2}}}$$
$${y_2} = \frac{2}{5}{t^{\frac{3}{2}}}$$

~~

~~Example 3

$$ay'' + by' + cy = 0$$

Given that $y_1 = e^{r_1t}$, and $r_1 = r_2 = -b/2a$.

If we standardize this, $p$ will be $b/a$.

Therefore, the formula gives:

$${y_2} = e^{r_1t} \int {e^{-\int b/a}\over (e^{r_1t})^2}$$
$${y_2} = e^{r_1t} \int {e^{-\frac{b}{a}t}\over e^{2(-b/2a)t}}$$
$${y_2} = e^{r_1t} \int {e^{-\frac{b}{a}t}\over e^{-\frac{b}{a}t}}$$
$${y_2} = e^{r_1t} \int 1$$
$${y_2} = e^{r_1t}*t$$
