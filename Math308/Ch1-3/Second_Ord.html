# Second Order Linear Equations

## Homogenous Equations

Remember that a second order equation is a function of t, y, and the first and second derivative of y.

$$F(t,y,y',y'')=0$$

Or in normal form:

$$y'' = f(t,y,y')$$

Or **Linear Form**:

$$P(t)y'' + Q(t)y' + R(t)y = G(t)$$

This is incredibly important for dynamics because the position of a particle and its acceleration due to a force are second derivatives:

$$F = ma \to a = x'' = f(t, x, x')$$

To solve these we need two initial conditions:

$$y(t_0) = y_0, y'(t_0) = y_0'$$

### Homogenous Equations with Constant Coefficients

A linear equation is **Homogenous** if $G(t)=0$. The next section discusses homogenous equations with constant coefficients:

$$ay'' + by' +cy=0$$

A side note is that second order equations have no general strategy for solving. For example, the Airy equation ($y'' - ty = 0$), requires a non-elementary function (one that we do not know from calculus) to solve. Generally speaking, linear equations (not homogenous ones with const. coefficients) will require non-elementary functions to solve.

As we have seen before, after substituting the Euler's trial function $y=e^{rt}$, we can simplify some equations. For example, we can use this with these special functions:

$$ay'' + by' +cy=0$$
$$a(r^2e^{rt}) + b(re^{rt}) +c(e^{rt})=0$$
$$a(r^2) + b(r) +c=0$$

Which can be solved for $r$ easily. If this equation has distinct real roots ($r_1 \ne r_2$ and ${b^2-4ac} > 0$), then the general solution of the equation has the form:

$$y = c_1 e^{r_1t}+c_2e^{r_2t}$$

Where $c_1, c_2$ are arbitrary constants.

!!Example 1

Solve $y'' + 4y' + 3y = 0$, $y(0) =2, y'(0)=-1$:

$y'' + 4y' + 3y = 0$
$r^2 + 4r + 3 = 0$
$$r = -1, -3$$

So, we can use the general solution:

$$y = c_1 e^{-t} + c_2 e^{-3t}$$
$$y(0) = c_1 + c_2 = 2$$
$$y'(0) = -c_1 - 3c_2 = -1$$

$$y(t) = -\frac{1}{2}e^{-3t}+\frac{5}{2} e^{-t}$$

!!

!!Example 2

Find the differential equation and IVP representing: $y=c_1e^{t/2}+c_2e^{-t/2}$

$$y(0) = 3, y'(0) = \beta$$

where the solution approaches 0 as $t \to \infty$

There is a general approach to finding a representative differential equation by taking the derivative and trying to eliminate the constants, but we can use the formulas to simplify this:

$$r_1 = 1/2, r_2 = -1/2$$
$$(r - 1/2)(r + 1/2) = r^2 - 1/4 = 0$$

$$y'' - \frac{1}{4} y = 0$$

To find $\beta$, we need to find what conditions cause $\lim\limits_{t \to \infty} y=c_1e^{t/2}+c_2e^{-t/2} = 0$.

Looking at this, we can see that $c_1 = 0$, so $c_2 = 3$ and $\beta = -\frac{3}{2}$ because:

$$y'(0) = \beta = \frac{c_1}{2} e^0 - \frac{c_2}{2} e^0$$
$$\beta = \frac{0}{2} - \frac{3}{2}$$

We can also see that $\beta$ is actually a determination of how the graph behaves, and $-\frac{3}{2}$ is a bifurcation value. Above it, the function blows up, and below it, the function goes to $-\infty$

!!

If we have $r_1 = r_2$ we will not have a unique solution because the general form will simplify to only one constant, which means that it is not a proper solution. This is because we fundamentally need two independent constants in a solution to a second-order equation

### Other Homogenous Equations

A Standard for has a coefficient of 1 on the $y''$ value:

$$y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y = g(t)$$

#### Existence and Uniqueness Theorem for Second Order Linear ODE's

If all three of the coefficient function in a standard-form equation are continuous over $I$, then there is a unique solution $y = \phi(t)$ of the IVP throughout the interval $I$.

!!Example 1

Determine the longest interval in which the initial value problem

$$(t^3 + t)y'' - \sin(t)y' + \arctan(t)y = 5t + 1, y(-1)=8, y'(-1)=-3$$

First, we need the function in standard form, so we need to divide by $t^3 + t$:

$$y'' - {\sin(t) \over (t^3 + t)}y' + {\arctan(t) \over (t^3 + t)}y = {5t + 1 \over (t^3 + t)}$$

We just need to find the continuous interval containing the initial values, so we need to find the values of (t) which are not valid:

$t^3 + t = 0$
$t = 0$

The domain of $\sin(t)$ and $\arctan(t)$ are continuous, so we only need t avoid $0$.

$$-\infty \lt t \lt 0$$
$$I = (-\infty, 0)$$

!!

#### Superposition Principle for Linear Homogeneous ODE's

If $y_1, y_2$ are two solutions of the ODE

$$y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y = 0$$

then any linear combination $c_1y_1 + c_2y_2$ is also a solution of the ODE, for any constant $c_1, c_2$.

The proof for this is:

$$(c_1y_1 + c_2y_2)'' + p(t)(c_1y_1 + c_2y_2)' + q(t)(c_1y_1 + c_2y_2) = 0$$
$$c_1y_1'' + c_2y_2'' + p(t)(c_1y_1' + c_2y_2') + q(t)(c_1y_1 + c_2y_2) = 0$$
$$c_1y_1'' + c_2y_2'' + p(t)c_1y_1' + p(t)c_2y_2' + q(t)c_1y_1 + q(t)c_2y_2 = 0$$
$$(c_1y_1'' + p(t)c_1y_1' + q(t)c_1y_1) + (c_2y_2'' + p(t)c_2y_2' + q(t)c_2y_2) = 0$$
$$c_1(y_1'' + p(t)y_1' + q(t)y_1) + c_2(y_2'' + p(t)y_2' + q(t)y_2) = 0$$

And since the functions are solutions, we can show that:

$$y_1'' + p(t)y_1' + q(t)y_1 = 0$$
$$y_2'' + p(t)y_2' + q(t)y_2 = 0$$

So:

$$c_1(y_1'' + p(t)y_1' + q(t)y_1) + c_2(y_2'' + p(t)y_2' + q(t)y_2) = 0$$
$$c_1(0) + c_2(0) = 0$$
$$0 = 0$$

#### Differential Operator

An operator is a function who's input is a function:

$$L(y(t))$$

For example the operator (* t^2) multiplies whatever it gets by t^2:

$$L(y) = y * t^2$$
$$L(3t+1) = (3t + 1) * t^2$$

The superpositon is just showing that a linear operator acts linearly:

$$L[c_1y_1 + c_2y_2] = c_1L[y_1] + c_2L[y_2]$$

So two solutions give rise to infinitely many solutions. But would this provide all the solutions or not? The answer is yes if the **Wronskian** is nonzero.

#### Wronskian

A Wronskian of two funstions $y_1(t)$ and $y_2(t)$ is defined by the following determinant

$$
W(t) = W(y_1, y_2) = 
\begin{vmatrix}
  y_1 && y_2 \\
  y_1' && y_2'
\end{vmatrix}
= y_1y_2' - y_2y_1'
$$

!!Example 2

Find the wronskian of the following pairs of functions:

1. $y_1(t) = \sin(t), y_2(t) = \cos(t)$

$$
W(t) = W(y_1, y_2) = 
\begin{vmatrix}
  \sin(t) && \cos(t) \\
  \cos(t) && -\sin(t)
\end{vmatrix}
= \sin(t)(-\sin(t)) - \cos(t)(\cos(t))
= -(\sin^2(t) + \cos^2(t)) = -1 \ne 0
$$

4. $y_1(t) = e^{rt}, y_2(t)=te^{rt}$

$$W(t) = (e^{rt})(rte^{rt}+e^{rt}) - (te^{rt})(re^{rt}) = rte^{2rt}+e^{2rt}) - rte^{2rt}) = e^{2rt} \ne 0$$

!!

#### Fundamental Set of Solutions

If the Wronskian of two solutions $y_1(t)$ and $y_2(t)$ of the ODE

$$y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y = 0$$

is nonzero at some $(t_0)$, or if $W(t)$ is not 0 everywhere, they form a fundamental set of solutions, meaning that you can linearly interpolate them to get a larger set of solutions.

!!Example 3

Show that $y_1(t) = 1/t^2$ and $y_2(t) = t^4$ form a fundamental set of solutions for 

$$t^2y'' - ty' - 8y = 0$$

First, we prove that they are both solutions:

$$y_1(t) = 1/t^2$$
$$y_1' = -2t^{-3}$$
$$y_1' = 6t^{-4}$$

$$L[y_1] = t^2(6t^{-4})-t(-2t^{-3})-8t^{-2} = 6t^{-2}+2t^{-2}-8t^{-2} = 0$$

The second one can be proved similarly.

Then, we seee if the Wronskian is at some time non-zero:

$$W[y_1,y_2] = 4t + 2t = 6t \ne 0$$

!!

Notice that if $y_1, y_2$ are linearly dependent, meaning that:

$y_1 = cy_2$

for all $t$, then the Wronskian is zero, but the converse is not true.

One last note: the Wronskian of three functions would just be the determinant of a matrix with thier first and second derivatives:

$$\
W[y_1,y_2,y_3] = 
\begin{vmatrix}
  y_1 && y_2 && y_3 \\
  y_1' && y_2' && y_3' \\
  y_1'' && y_2'' && y_3''
\end{vmatrix}
$$

The determinant of a matrix can wither be found using the diagonals, or more generally, by moving down a row, and multiplying it by the elements in the rows/columns that the element you are focusing on is not it. For more detail on this, look up matrix determinants. 

This will allow us to find a wronskian for higher (third) order equations. However, if the same substitution is used, you will get a cubic function.
