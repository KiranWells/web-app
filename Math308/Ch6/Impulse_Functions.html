# Impulse Functions

In physics, there will often be questions where there will be a large value over a very small time, such as the forces in a collision. To deal with these kinds of forces, physicists use the **Dirac delta function** ($\delta(t)$) (also called **unit impulse**)

~~an explanation of impulse

If a force is a function of time, the the impulse is the integral with respect to time. 

$$I = \int\limits_a^b F(t)dt$$

If we represent the force as mass times the delta velocity:

$$I = \int\limits_a^b m\frac{dv}{dt}dt = mv(b) - mv(a)$$

Impulse, therefore, is the change in momentum.
~~

Given a very large impulse occuring in a very small time, the $\delta(t)$ can be used to represent it. It is defined as the a function with area of 1 underneath and zero width:

$$
\delta(t) = 
\begin{cases}
  0 && t \ne 0 \\
  \infty && t = 0
\end{cases}
$$

This can be explained by taking a rectangle with area one and taking the limits as its width approaches infinity. 

The main use is called its "sifting property". By multiplying the delta function by any other function, it removes all values aside from the one where $\delta(T) \to T = 0$.

$$\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t - c)f(t)dt = \frac{1}{\epsilon}*\epsilon f(c) = f(c)$$

Note that this uses a shift of $c$ to change where the value of $f(t)$ is taken. This is called "sifting" because it allows us to take the value of a function at only one point.

This property makes it easy to compute the Laplace of $\delta(t)$:

$$\mathcal{L}\{\delta(t - c)\} = \int\limits_0^{\infty} e^{-st}\delta(t - c)dt = e^{-sc}$$

This gives us Rule 26. Another important feature is that when taking the Laplace of a function multiplied by the delta function, we can treat $e^{-st}$ and the other function itself as $f(t)$, meaning we just take its value at $c$:

$$\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\delta(t)\}=e^{-sc}f(c)$$

~~Example 1

1. $\mathcal{L}\{\delta(t - \pi\} = e^{-\pi s}$
2. $\mathcal{L}\{(t^3 - 2t)\delta(t - 3)\} = 21e^{-3s}$
3. $\mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{{s^2 \over s^2 + 1}\right\}$

This one can be split into $1 - {1\over s^2 + 1}$ by long division, which results in:

$$\delta(t) - \sin(t)$$

~~

## Impulsive Force Definition

If a force is very large over a very short time, then we can model such forces as:

$$F(t) = I*\delta(t-c)$$

Notice that this gives the correct value for impulse, as integrating will result in $I$.

~~Example 2 - Physics Example

A bat hits a baseball with mass 0.15 kg at time t = 3 sec, when the baseball has a speed of 40 m/s. After the collision with the bat, with a contact time of 0.5 ms, the baseball has a speed of 50 m/s in the opposide direction. Estimate the average impulse and model the impulse with $\delta(t)$.

Here we can use the change in momentum to find the impulse:

$$I = \Delta P = m\Delta v = 0.15 * (50 - (-40)) = 13.5\ N s$$

Then solving for the force:

$$F_{avg} * \epsilon = I$$
$$F_{avg} = 13.5/5\times 10^{-4}$$
$$= 2.7\times 10^4\ N$$

Modeling this with the Dirac delta function:

$$F = I*\delta(t - 3) = 13.5*\delta(t-3)\ N$$

~~

~~Example 3

A mass of 2kg is attached to a spring (k = 8 N/m) and damped with a constant of 4 N s/m. The mass is released from rest when the spring is stretched to 3 m. Then the mass is struck with a hammer at t = 2 sec, providing an impulst of 16 N s. Then it is struck again at t = 5, changing the velocity by -2 m/s. Determine the motion of the mass.

Here, we are given a physical process and asked for the position with respect to time.

Collecting all of the information we have:

$$m = 2, k = 8, \gamma = 4$$

The initial conditions are:

$$y(0) = 3, y' (0) = 0$$

Modeling the force using the delta function gives (using impulse):

$$F_{ext} = 16\delta(t - 2) + 2(-2)\delta(t - 5)$$

A model of a damped spring is:

$$my'' + \gamma y' + ky = F_{ext}$$

So out problem to solve is:

$$2y'' + 4y' + 8y =  16\delta(t - 2) + 2(-2)\delta(t - 5), y(0) = 3, y'(0) = 0$$

First, using Laplace:

$$\mathcal{L}\{y(t)\} = Y(t)$$

$$2(s^2 Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0)) + 4(sY(s) - y(0)) + 8Y(s) = 16e^{-2s} - 4e^{-5s}$$
$$(s^2 Y(s) - 3s) + 2(sY(s) - 3) + 4Y(s) = 8e^{-2s} - 2e^{-5s}$$
$$(s^2 + 2s + 4)Y(s) = 3s+6+8e^{-2s} - 2e^{-5s}$$
$$Y(s) = {3s+6+8e^{-2s} - 2e^{-5s} \over s^2 + 2s + 4}$$

Now we do inverse Laplace. First, we can divide the fraction into separate pieces, then solve:

$$F(s) = {3s+6 \over s^2 + 2s + 4} + (8e^{-2s} - 2e^{-5s}){1\over (s + 1)^2 + 3}$$

One note is that the fraction multiplied by the e's is called the transfer fuction, as it always occurs when related to the impulse.

$$F(s) = {3(s+1)+3 \over s^2 + 2s + 4} + (8e^{-2s} - 2e^{-5s}){1\over (s + 1)^2 + 3}$$

$$f(t) = e^{-t}(3\cos(\sqrt{3}t) + \sqrt{3}\sin(\sqrt{3}t)) + \mathcal{L}\left\{ 8e^{-2s} - 2e^{-5s}\left(1\over (s + 1)^2 + 3\right) \right\}$$
$$f(t) = e^{-t}(3\cos(\sqrt{3}t) + \sqrt{3}\sin(\sqrt{3}t))$$
$$+8 u_2(t)e^{-(t-2)}\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\sin(\sqrt{3}(t - 2)) - 2u_5(t)e^{-(t-5)}\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\sin(\sqrt{3}(t - 5)) $$

The explanation of this is as follows: the first portion is the movement of the function without any force. Then, after a time delay of 2 seconds, another function increases the velocity in the positive direction. Then, once t reaches 5 seconds, another function increases the velocity in the negative direction.
