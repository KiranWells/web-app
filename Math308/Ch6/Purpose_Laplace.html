# Purpose of Laplace Transform

## Solving Initial Value Problems

The purpose of the Laplace transform in differential equations is that it changes the derivative to a normal function:

### Theorem

If $f$ is continuous and of exponential order, and $f'$ is piecewise continuous on any interval. Then the Laplace transform of $f'$ exists for $s \gt a$, and:

$$\mathcal{L}\{f'(t)\} = s\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} - f(0)$$

This can be proved by using integration by parts:

$$\mathcal{L}\{f'(t)\} = \int\limits_0^{\infty} e^{-st}f'(t)dt$$
$$= e^{-st}f(t)|_0^{\infty} - \int\limits_0^{\infty} -se^{-st}f(t)$$
$$= 0 - e^{0}f(0) - \mathcal{L}\{-sf(t)\}$$
$$= -f(0) + s\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\}$$

Remember, $s$ is considered to be a constant, and we are assuming the conditions above are true, namely $s > a$ for some $a$ that proves $f$ is of exponential order.

We can also prove a similar formula for higher derivatives:

$$\mathcal{L}\{f''(t)\} = s\mathcal{L}\{f'(t)\} - f'(0)$$

Which can be simplified to:

$$\mathcal{L}\{f''(t)\} = s^2\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} - sf(0) - f'(0)$$

So we have a continuing formula:

$$
\begin{cases}
  f(t) && F(s) \\
  f'(t) && sF(s) - f(0) \\
  f''(t) && s(sF(s) - f(0)) - f'(0) \\
  ...
  f^{(n)}(t) && s^nF(s) - \sum\limits_0^{n-1} s^{n - i - 1}f^{(i)}(0)
\end{cases}
$$

## Inverse Laplace Transform

We need to get back from the $s$ function to $t$, so we find an operation which does that:

$$F(s) = \mathcal{L}\{f(t)\}$$
$$f(t) = \mathcal{L}^{-1}\{F(s\}$$

However, one caveat is that at jumps (discontinuities), the Laplace transform cannot determine the value *at* the jump. This is not meaningful in practice (the jump is an infinitesimally small point).

~~Example 1

Find the Inverse Laplace of:

$$F(s) = {2s + 1 \over s^2 + 9} + {3 \over (s - 5)^4} - {5s - 2\over s^2 - 2}$$

First, split the first element into two portions. This will allow us to use the patterns we know to find:

$$f(t) = 2\cos(3t) + \frac{1}{3}\sin(3t)$$

These are found by taking the exponent and using the formula from last lecture:

$$F(s) = {s - a \over (s - a)^2 + b^2}$$
For the real part ($\cos$), and 
$$F(s) = {b \over (s - a)^2 + b^2}$$
For the imaginary part ($\sin$)

For the second portion, we have a larger exponent in the denominator, which follows the pattern of multiplying by several $t$s (see a [table of Laplace transforms](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/pdf/Laplace_Table.pdf) to verify this).

This will result in (using Rule 23):

$$f(t) = \frac{1}{2}t^3e^{5t}$$

The last can be divided in two found in a table of laplace transforms as (using Rules 17 and 18):

$$f(t) = - 5\cosh(\sqrt{2}t) + \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}\sinh(\sqrt{2}t)$$

~~

### Rule of multiplication by $t$

$$F(s) = \int\limits_0^{\infty} e^{-st}f(t)dt$$
$$F'(s) = \int\limits_0^{\infty}\frac{\partial}{\partial s} [e^{-st}f(t)]dt$$
$$F'(s) = \int\limits_0^{\infty}[-te^{-st}f(t) + e^{-st}(\frac{\partial}{\partial s} f(t) = 0)]dt$$
$$F'(s) = \int\limits_0^{\infty}-te^{-st}f(t)dt$$
$$F'(s) = -\mathcal{L}\{tf(t)\}$$

This will turn into the general rule (Rule 30) for higher powers of $t$:

$$F^{(n)} = (-1)^n \mathcal{L}\{t^nf(t)\}$$
$$ \mathcal{L}\{t^nf(t)\} = (-1)^nF^{(n)}$$

This helps with deriving more complex rules for Laplace transformations.

## Application

~~Example 2

Use Laplace to solve
$$y' + 7y = 0, y(0) = 3$$

This can easily be solved using other formulas, but taking laplace of both sides we get:

$$(sF(s) - 3) + 7F(s) = 0$$
$$F(s) = {3 \over s + 7}$$
$$f(t) = 3e^{-7t}$$
