# Classification of DEs

If a DE can be written as a linear combination of the unknown function and its derivatives, it is called **linear**.

$$a_n(t)y^{(n)} + ... = g(t)$$

Ex:

$$3ty''' + 2t^2 y' = g(t)$$

If $g(t) = 0$, the equation is homogeneous.

Classify each DE:

1. ${x^2y'' + y\over y'} = \cos x$
  this is linear and homogenous
2. $y'' + (y^2 - 1)y' - t^3y = \tan t$
  This is nonlinead=r, and even if it was, it would be non-homogenous because $\tan t$ has no $y$ attached to it, so it is $g(t) \ne 0$.
3. $u_{xxx} - 3u_{xy} + (x^2 + y^3)u_x = 1 - u$
  In this case, it is linear, since any function of $x$ and $y$ can be in it, and any partial derivative of $u$. However it is non-homogenous as $g(x,y) = 1$
4. $u_{xx} + uu_y = 0$
  non-linear since $u$ is multiplied by $u_y$

## Basic Mathematical models

A DE that describes some physical process is often called a **mathematical model** of the process.

Example 6:

A bullet enters a board of thickness h with a velocity v_0 and goes out with a velocity v_1. Considering the resistance force of the board to the movement of the bullet is prroportional to the square of the velocity, find the time required for the bullet to pass through the board.

So, we can write down the rule we are told:

$$F = -kv^2$$

Where $k$ is some constant that represents how the velocity squared is proportional to F.

Since Distance is the average velocity multiblied by time, we can solve for time by dividing $h$ by the average velocity. However, we do not know the average velocity. But, we can estimate from our data and assuming a linear change (which is clearly false).

$$T \approxeq {h\over \frac{v_0 + v_1}{2}} $$

We can use Newton's law to start

$$F = ma$$

$$m\frac{dv}{dt} = -kv^2$$
$$\frac{dv}{dt} = {-kv^2\over m}$$

This is a non-linear, first-order, ordinary differential equation.

Now, we can also define the other values we have:

$$v(0) = v_0, v(T) = v_1, x(T) = h$$

One note is that we would need as many initial conditions as there are orders in the equation.

So now, we are trying to find $T$, and perhaps $\frac{k}{m}$

One strategy would be to find the equation for the position:

$$x' = v(t)$$
$$x(0) = 0$$

(Try it yourself)

A shorter approach is to find a relationship between the position and the velocity:

$$\frac{dv}{dt} = -\alpha v^2$$

Where $\alpha$ is $\frac{k}{m}$.

We want to change the independent variable to $x$ instead of $t$

We can do this by multiplying 

$$\frac{dv}{dx} * \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{dv}{dt}$$

And $\frac{dx}{dt}$ is just the velocity $v$, so we can rewrite it as:

$$v\frac{dv}{dx} = -\alpha v^2$$
$$\frac{dv}{dx} = -\alpha v$$

Here, we cannot really integrate with respect to $x$, since we do not know $v$. We could use an integrated equation to iterate, plugging in values over and over to approximate an equation.

Instead, we can either recognize the pattern, or we can rearrange it to a combination we know. For example, we know that $\frac{d}{dx}\ln(x) = frac{dx}{x}$

Now we can rearrange and integrate both sides.

$$\frac{dv}{dx} = -\alpha v$$
$$\int{\frac{dv}{dx}\over v} = \int -\alpha$$
$$\ln(v) = -\alpha x + C$$

Now we can use our initial conditions to solve for $C$.

$v(0) = v_0$
$\ln(v_0) = -\alpha (0) + C$
$C = \ln(v_0)$

After simplifying, we get:

$$v(x) = v_0 e^{-\alpha x}$$

Now we can use the initial conitions to find $\alpha$:

$$v(h) = v_1 = v_0 e^{-\alpha h}$$
$$\alpha  = -({\ln(\frac{v_1}{v_0}) \over h})$$

Now we can find the exact average velocity.

$$T = \frac{h}{v_{avg}} = {h\over (\int\limit_0^h v_0e^{-\alpha x} dx)/h}$$
$$= {h^2 / v_0 \over (-\frac{1}{\alpha}e^{-\alpha h} - 1)}$$

And we simplify:

$$T = {h^2 {({\ln(\frac{v_0}{v_1}) \over h})}\over v_0 - v_1}$$

## Direction Fields

An equation solved for $y'$ is called a **normal form**.

$$y' = f(t,y)$$

This equation allows us to display a grid of values of $y'$, which are the slopes at that point. By making a graph of $y$ and $t$, and drawing the slopes at each point, we can get a vector field (direction field).

<details>
  <summary>Click to show Example 7.</summary>

Example 7:

Draw a direction field for the ODE $y' = 3 - y$. Then use that to determine the behavior as $t\to\inf$

We can plot it by hand by plugging in values at each point. For example, if $y =3$, the slope is 0.

In addition, $t$ does not affect the equation (it is autonomous), so the slope will be identical across all $t$s.

![Direction Field](DirecField.png)

Here, we can see that the equation will always converge to $3$, and the solution $y = 3$ will be a horizontal line.

This line is the **equilibrium solution** (any constant would be one).

This is stable equilibrium, as all values converge to 3, even with small variations in the stating point.

</details>

### Equilibrium Solutions

Any constant solution of a DE is called an **equilibrium solution**, meaning that any solution that only contains a constant expression is such a solution.

We can find such solutions by finding a point where the derivatives are all $0$. So,

$$y'' - xy = 0$$
$$0 - xy = 0$$
$$y = 0$$

$$y'' - xy = 1$$
$$0 - xy = 1$$
$$y = -1/x$$

So, the second equation does not have an equilibrium solution, as there is no constant $y$ that will satisfy all values of $x$

Another example is:

$y' = \sin(y)\cos(t^2)$

This is in equilibrium for any $y$ for which $\sin(y) = 0$, meaning $0, \pi, 2\pi,...$

All solutions in this class will be real, but imaginary values can be used as intermediate values.

Question:
Draw a direction field for $y' = y^2 - y^4$ and find the equilibrium solutions.
Then use that to determine the behavios of $y$ as $t \to \inf$

We can see from the equation that the eqilibrium solutions are $0, 1, -1$.
From there, we can draw som conclusions from the behavior of $y'$.

![The direction Field](DirecField.jpeg)

Above 1, the slope slowly decreases as $y$ increases.
Below -1, the slope decreases as y decreases.
Between these, the slope is positive, growing more positive the farther from each equilibrium solution.

Because of this behavior, we can determine that lines as $t\to\inf$, will move toward wither $1$, $0$, or $-\inf$.
Of course, for the case of equilibrium, they will stay the same.

To be clear, this is as $t$ increases; as it might not be able to go to infinity.

### Types of asymptotes

In the previous example, some of the asymptotes converged from both directions, and some diverged.

A stable asymptote converges from both sides; an unstable one diverges from both sides.

A semistable one diverges from one side and converges from the other.

## Autonomous systems

Autonomous systems have a property that allows you to find a similar solution by shifting the function.

For example, an equation will have some constant of integration that allows you to find multiple solutions.

$$y' = 2t$$
$$y = t^2 + C$$

This C can be changed to find many solutions. 

In this case, the differential equation does not actually depend on y, so it can easily be integrated. In more complex equations, the location of the constant may be located in many other places.

$$y' = y$$
$$y = Ce^x$$

## Behavior of a function

We can use direction fields to visualize an equation, and combined with the asymptotes, we can undestand the behavior of a function.

<details>

Question:
Solve the initial value problem (IVP)

$${dy\over dt} = ay + b$$
$$y(0) = y_0$$

Where $a$ and $b$ are constants and $a$ is non-zero.

In this case, integration will not immediately help, because we cannot integrate $y$ with respect to $t$.

In this case, we can divide by the right side to get:

$${\frac{dy}{dt}\over ay + b} = 1$$

We can now integrate both sides:

$$\int{\frac{dy}{dt}\over ay + b}dt = \int 1dt$$

In this case, we are dividing by $y + b$, so we need to account for if that is 0:

$y = -b/a$

This happens to be an equilibrium solution.

Now, we can further simplify the original equation, assuming $ay +b \ne 0$:

$$\int{\frac{dy}{dt}\over ay + b}dt = \int 1dt$$
$$\frac{1}{a}\ln|ay+b| = t + C$$

At this point, we can solve for $C$ given $y_0 = 0$.

$$C = \frac{1}{a}\ln|ay_0+b|$$

$$\ln|ay+b| = at + aC$$
$$|ay+b| = e^{at + aC}$$
$$|ay+b| = e^{aC}e^{at}$$
$$|ay+b| = C_1e^{at}$$

Where $C_1 = e^{aC}$ 

$$C_1 = e^{a(\frac{1}{a}\ln|ay_0+b|)}$$
$$C_1 = |ay_0+b|$$

In this case we can simplify to 

$$ay + b = \pm e^{at} ay + b$$

But only the positive solution satisfies the initial value. So now we can solve for y.

$$y = e^{at}(y_0 + \frac{b}{a}) - \frac{b}{a}$$

Using the direction field and the asymptote, we can see that all values will either converge or diverge from the asymptote based on whether $a$ is positive or negative. (converging when negative, diverging when positive).

Question 12:
Given an object of mass $m$ falling in an atmosphere with a drag coefficient of $\gamma$, assuming the drag force is $F = \gamma v$, find the behavior for $v$.

Here, we can define $F = ma$. In this case, $a = \frac{dv}{dt}$, so if we solve for $a$:

$$\frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{F}{m}$$

Also, the force is the sum of all forces on the object, so adding gravity and the drag:

$$F = mg - \gamma v$$

So, we plug it in:

$$\frac{dv}{dt} ={mg - \gamma v \over m}$$
$$\frac{dv}{dt} = g - \frac{\gamma}{m} v$$

We can model the behavior of this with a direction field, and see that the graphs converge to an equilibrium solution $$v_t = \frac{mg}{\gamma}$$

We can follow the same strategy as above to divide by the right and integrate based on $\int \frac{dx}{x} = \ln|x|$.
